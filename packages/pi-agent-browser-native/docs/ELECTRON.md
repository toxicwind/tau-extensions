## Purpose

This guide is the entry point for using `pi-agent-browser-native` against desktop **Electron** applications. The wrapper exposes a top-level `electron` shorthand that owns the awkward discover → launch → attach → probe → cleanup sequence so agents do not hand-build `--remote-debugging-port` argv, poll `DevToolsActivePort`, and `kill` profile directories. After attach, the rest of the native `agent_browser` surface (`snapshot`, `find`, `click`, `fill`, `get`, `eval --stdin`, `batch`, `qa.attached`, and similar) works the same way it does against a web page.

This document is structured for users, not implementers. Field-level rules live in [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#electron); this guide focuses on **when** and **how** to use them, and on the safety and ownership boundary the wrapper enforces.

## Who this is for

- **Pi users** who want an agent to operate a local Electron app the same way it operates a web page.
- **Coding agents** that need a low-context lifecycle for desktop apps such as VS Code, Cursor, Obsidian, Slack, or any app built on Electron, without re-implementing the CDP attach dance every session.
- **Maintainers and reviewers** validating the wrapper's Electron behavior before release; verification evidence lives under `RQ-0096` in [`SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`](SUPPORT_MATRIX.md).

It is **not** an upstream `agent-browser` reference and it does **not** replace the canonical [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#electron) for exact field semantics, validation rules, or failure categories.

## Mental model

```
electron.list       → discover Electron apps (host-only; no upstream spawn)
electron.launch     → launch a wrapper-owned isolated app, attach via CDP, hand off (snapshot|tabs|connect)
electron.status     → liveness, debug-port, and target inspection (read-only)
electron.probe      → compact one-call state read (title/url/focus/tabs/snapshot)
electron.cleanup    → close managed session, stop the tracked process, remove the temp profile
qa.attached         → smoke check against the currently attached session (no URL)
```

Two ownership modes coexist:

1. **Wrapper-owned launches** — `electron.launch` starts a brand-new app process with an **isolated temporary user-data-dir** and an **OS-chosen debug port**. The wrapper records a `launchId` for every such launch and `electron.cleanup` only operates on those `launchId`s.
2. **Manually launched apps** — you start the Electron app yourself (for example with `open -a Slack --args --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-allow-origins='*'`), then attach with `{ "args": ["connect", "9222"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }`. The wrapper does not own that process; **you** are responsible for shutting it down and cleaning its profile.

Choosing between the two is a real decision, not a stylistic one. See [Wrapper-owned vs manually launched](#wrapper-owned-vs-manually-launched).

## Quick start

Discover the app, launch with the default snapshot handoff, work with current refs, then clean up:

```json
{ "electron": { "action": "list", "query": "code" } }
{ "electron": { "action": "launch", "appName": "Visual Studio Code", "handoff": "snapshot" } }
{ "args": ["snapshot", "-i"] }
{ "electron": { "action": "probe", "timeoutMs": 5000 } }
{ "electron": { "action": "cleanup", "launchId": "electron-…" } }
```

The launch result carries both a `launchId` (used by `status`/`probe`/`cleanup`) and an attached `sessionName` (used by browser-style `snapshot`/`tab`/`click`/`find` calls). Read both from `details.electron.launch` and `details.electron.identifiers`. With default implicit session reuse, the quick-start `args: ["snapshot", "-i"]` line uses that attached session without an extra `--session` argument; pass `--session` explicitly when you target a named upstream session instead.

For a quick "is the app actually showing what we expect?" smoke check after attach:

```json
{ "qa": { "attached": true, "expectedText": "Explorer", "screenshotPath": ".dogfood/electron.png" } }
```

`qa.attached` runs against the **current managed session** without opening a URL, so it works for any attached app — wrapper-owned or manually launched.

## Wrapper-owned vs manually launched

Pick the mode that matches the **state you need**.

| | `electron.launch` (wrapper-owned) | `args: ["connect", …]` (manual host launch) |
|---|---|---|
| Profile | Isolated temporary `userDataDir` | The app's normal profile (your real signed-in state) |
| Debug port | OS-chosen via `--remote-debugging-port=0` and `DevToolsActivePort` | Caller-supplied port (for example `9222`) |
| Signed-in state | **No** — first-run or empty profile | **Yes** — whatever is in the launched profile |
| Already-running app | Cannot attach to it | Required (or relaunch yourself with a debug port) |
| Lifecycle ownership | Wrapper owns shutdown and profile cleanup | **You** own shutdown and profile cleanup |
| When to use | Anything you can do against a fresh app: tooling, UX flows, scripted local QA, exploring panels, packaged debugging | Tasks that explicitly need the user's signed-in Slack/Obsidian/VS Code state |
| How to clean up | `electron.cleanup` with the returned `launchId` | Close the app yourself; do **not** call `electron.cleanup` |

### Manual host-launch pattern

When the explicit goal is the user's signed-in local app state and the app is not already running:

```bash
# macOS example
open -a Slack --args --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-allow-origins='*'
```

Then attach and choose a ready target before using refs:

```json
{ "args": ["connect", "9222"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }
{ "args": ["tab", "list"] }
{ "args": ["tab", "t2"] }
{ "args": ["snapshot", "-i"] }
{ "qa": { "attached": true, "expectedText": "Channels" } }
```

A successful `connect` means the CDP endpoint accepted the session; it does **not** prove the app has an active rendered page yet. Prefer `details.nextActions` when present: `verify-connected-session-url` performs the only page read allowed while the attached target is unverified, and `list-connected-session-tabs` inspects attached targets. A verified target clears the guard; otherwise navigate explicitly or select the intended tab. After the read-only list, select or confirm a stable `t<N>` target, verify it with `get url`, and run `snapshot -i` explicitly before trusting refs. If the first `snapshot -i` says `No active page`, follow `list-tabs-after-no-active-page`. If it returns no useful refs without that error, manually run `tab list`, select a stable `t<N>` id for the app surface, then retry a condition wait or `snapshot -i` on that selected target.

If the app is already running without a debug port, ask before relaunching it — relaunching may lose unsaved state and Electron's single-instance behavior will silently drop a second invocation's `--remote-debugging-port` flag.

## Readiness and waits

Use this ladder for desktop-host readiness instead of blind sleep loops:

1. Prefer a real condition when one exists: `wait --text`, `wait --url`, `wait --fn`, `wait --load <state>`, or `wait --download`.
2. After raw `connect`, inspect targets with `tab list`, select the stable `tab t<N>` app surface, then use a condition wait or `snapshot -i` on that selected surface.
3. After wrapper-owned `electron.launch`, use `electron.probe` or `electron.status` when launch health, debug-port liveness, or target mismatch matters.
4. Use `qa.attached` when the readiness check can be expressed as expected text or selector plus diagnostics against the current managed session.
5. Use fixed waits only as a last resort. For legitimately slow waits, pass an explicit upstream wait timeout and let the wrapper derive the subprocess watchdog, or set top-level `timeoutMs` to at least the wait duration plus a small grace window.
6. Treat a fixed-wait payload such as `"waited":"timeout"` as elapsed time, not proof that the host finished. Verify with an observed condition, fresh `snapshot -i`, or screenshot before continuing.

This project is not adding a first-class host-idle primitive yet. Revisit that only if repeated desktop smokes show that condition waits, `qa.attached`, `electron.probe`, snapshots, and screenshots cannot cover the workflow.

## Action reference

The exact field schemas, validation rules, and `details.*` payload shapes live in [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md#electron`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#electron). This section is a usage-oriented overview.

### `electron.list` — discover apps

Host-only scan; does not spawn upstream `agent-browser`. macOS (`/Applications/*.app`, `~/Applications/*.app`) and Linux (`.desktop` launchers under standard XDG, Flatpak, and Snap locations) are supported in v1. On Windows (and any non-macOS/non-Linux host), `list` returns `details.electron.platform: "unsupported"` with an empty `apps` array—use `executablePath` (or a host `appPath` that resolves to a verifiable Electron binary) for `launch` instead; `inspectElectronExecutablePath` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/electron/discovery.ts` still gates Windows executables before spawn.

```json
{ "electron": { "action": "list", "query": "code", "maxResults": 25 } }
```

Returns app metadata under `details.electron.apps`: `name`, optional `bundleId`/`desktopId`, `appPath`, `executablePath`, `platform`, and optional non-blocking `sensitivity` annotations. Apps flagged as likely sensitive (categories such as `notes`, `chat`, `mail`, `developer-workspace`, or `passwords-auth`) are printed with `[likely sensitive: …]`. These are **advisory hints**, not enforcement; see [Safety and ownership](#safety-and-ownership) for the policy boundary.

### `electron.launch` — launch and attach

Pass **exactly one** target: `appPath`, `appName`, `bundleId`, or `executablePath`. The wrapper resolves the target, verifies Electron framework evidence, applies optional caller-owned `allow` / `deny` policy, creates an isolated temp `userDataDir`, launches with `--remote-debugging-port=0` plus safe defaults, reads `DevToolsActivePort`, then attaches through upstream `connect` as a fresh managed session.

```json
{
  "electron": {
    "action": "launch",
    "appName": "Visual Studio Code",
    "handoff": "snapshot",
    "targetType": "page",
    "timeoutMs": 30000,
    "appArgs": ["--disable-telemetry"]
  }
}
```

Handoff selection (`handoff` field):

| Value | Behavior | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `"snapshot"` (default) | Attach, verify `get url`, list targets, capture `snapshot -i` in one call | You need interactive refs immediately for clicks/fills |
| `"tabs"` | Attach, verify `get url`, and list targets only | Safer diagnostic start when you only need target discovery |
| `"connect"` | Attach and stop | You will run your own follow-up commands |

`targetType` defaults to `"page"`; use `"webview"` or `"any"` for apps whose useful UI is exposed as a webview target.

Optional `timeoutMs` on `electron.launch` sets the host readiness polling budget for `DevToolsActivePort` and CDP metadata. The clock starts after target discovery and policy checks; upstream attach and handoff have separate subprocess budgets. When omitted, the default is **15 seconds** with a hard maximum of **120 seconds**, matching `ELECTRON_LAUNCH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` and `ELECTRON_LAUNCH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/electron/launch.ts`. Pi cancellation is separate: an already-cancelled call never launches the app, while cancellation during readiness polling or URL/tab/snapshot handoff closes the managed session, stops the tracked process, removes its isolated profile, and returns `failureCategory: "aborted"` without waiting for the launch timeout.

Wrapper-owned launches **always** use an isolated temp profile and an OS-chosen port. If wrapper validation, managed-session policy, or the post-attach live-URL handoff guard fails after the host app starts, the wrapper immediately stops that process and removes the isolated profile; it retains a partial tracked record only when cleanup itself cannot finish. `--user-data-dir`, `--remote-debugging-port`, `--remote-debugging-address`, `--remote-debugging-pipe`, and bare `--` in `appArgs` are rejected. There is no caller-supplied port and no way to make `electron.launch` reuse the app's normal signed-in profile or attach to an already-running app — by design. Use the manual path described above when those are the actual requirements.

### `electron.status` — liveness and targets

Read-only inspection of one or more tracked launches. Without `launchId` or `all`, it selects the single active wrapper launch when unambiguous.

```json
{ "electron": { "action": "status" } }
{ "electron": { "action": "status", "launchId": "electron-…" } }
{ "electron": { "action": "status", "all": true } }
```

Reports `cleanupState`, current debug-port and PID liveness, bounded CDP targets, and freshly measured `userDataDirState` under `details.electron.statuses`. An explicit `launchId` can inspect a **historical cleaned launch record**; default and `all: true` selection exclude cleaned records. Cleanup history does not determine current liveness. The tracked profile path is `present`, `absent` (only native `lstat` ENOENT), or `unknown` (other filesystem errors); a dangling symlink is present. This measures that path only, not all app residue, and is not stored in the launch record. Its managed-session title/URL reads hold the normal daemon-policy lock and owned restore context. Mismatch fields surface when the current managed session or tab no longer matches a live wrapper launch target — typically the cue to follow `reattach-electron-launch` before trusting old refs.

### `electron.probe` — compact state read

`probe` collapses what would otherwise be separate `get url` / `get title` / focused-element `eval` / `tab list` / `snapshot -i` calls into one bounded result. Use it instead of chaining those reads when you just need a quick "where are we?" check. The wrapper holds the managed-session daemon-policy lock for the probe and runs every underlying read with the session's owned restore decision, so probing cannot restart the daemon under a different restore key.

```json
{ "electron": { "action": "probe" } }
{ "electron": { "action": "probe", "launchId": "electron-…", "timeoutMs": 5000 } }
```

Output appears under `details.electron.probe`: `title`, `url`, `focusedElement`, `activeTab`, `tabs`, compact `snapshot` metadata (`refCount`, `refIds`, optional text preview and omission counts), and `errors`. If every underlying read fails, the tool fails with `failureCategory: "upstream-error"`; it does not report a successful empty partial probe. Probes reject an unverified target before helper reads, then verify the live URL again before title, eval, tab, or snapshot helpers so external target drift cannot expose the wrong page. A current-managed probe also persists top-level `details.namespace`, `sessionTabTarget`, and `refSnapshot` so Pi reload/branch replay keeps the same namespaced page identity; unverified transitions persist as `details.sessionTabTargetUnknown: true` until `get url` or explicit navigation establishes a trustworthy target. When `launchId` is given, the probe is tied to that tracked launch and will surface mismatch guidance if the wrapper sees a session or target drift; visible output also includes debug-port/pid liveness so a stale `about:blank` against a dead launch is unmistakable.

`timeoutMs` bounds each underlying read subprocess. Use it for dense desktop apps when the default budget is too short, or to fail fast when you suspect the app process is wedged.

### `electron.cleanup` — wrapper-owned only

Closes the tracked managed session, stops only the wrapper-tracked process, verifies that the debug port no longer serves `/json/version`, and removes the wrapper-created `userDataDir`. Cleanup partial failures fail the tool result with `failureCategory: "cleanup-failed"` and the `retry-electron-cleanup` next action references the same `launchId` so retries are bounded.

```json
{ "electron": { "action": "cleanup", "launchId": "electron-…" } }
{ "electron": { "action": "cleanup", "all": true } }
```

`electron.cleanup` **never** targets:

- manually launched apps
- externally supplied debug ports
- arbitrary Electron processes the wrapper did not start
- explicit screenshots, downloads, PDFs, traces, HAR files, or recordings saved to caller-chosen paths

For manual launches, close commands (`close`, `quit`, or `exit`) only close the browser/CDP session. Close the app yourself and clean its profile/temp files with normal host tools.

On Pi `quit`, active wrapper-owned Electron launches are best-effort cleaned. On `/reload`, the current branch-visible active Electron launch and its isolated temp `userDataDir` are preserved for continuity while off-branch owned Electron launches are cleaned before process-local ownership is cleared. First reuse after reload/resume checks that the PID and profile are present, the saved browser WebSocket endpoint still matches the live app, and upstream `get cdp-url` points to that browser or one of its current targets. Ordinary browser calls, status reads, and probes share this check under the existing session lock; no reconnect or ref reset is needed. The `get cdp-url` read honors the caller's `timeoutMs` and cancellation, while localhost CDP requests keep their short fixed fetch budgets. Missing or mismatched evidence does not grant reuse, and generic restore-disabled sessions keep their existing rules. If cleanup is partial and skips or fails `user-data-dir` removal because the process or debug port is still live, the generic temp sweep preserves that profile path across reload, quit, repeated temp cleanup, process-exit cleanup, and stale temp-root pruning after restart rather than deleting it out from under the remaining host resource. If `electron.cleanup` closes the attached managed session but host process/profile cleanup is partial, later default browser calls still rotate away from that closed wrapper-managed session. Stale restored records (PID gone, port dead) are **reported** instead of guessed at or killed.

### `timeoutMs` by action (quick reference)

`electron.list` has no configurable timeout: neither top-level `timeoutMs` nor nested `electron.timeoutMs` is accepted for its host scan. For every other action, nested `timeoutMs` applies to **different surfaces**, not an end-to-end action deadline. Authoritative rules and env overrides live under **Validation and defaults** in [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md#electron`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#electron).

| Action | What `timeoutMs` covers when set | Typical default when omitted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `launch` | Host-side wait for `DevToolsActivePort` and CDP readiness | **15 s**, hard-capped at **120 s** (`normalizeTimeoutMs` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/electron/launch.ts`) |
| `status` | Each optional managed-session `get url` / `get title` subprocess, including `get cdp-url` when verifying a restored connection | Normal wrapper subprocess budget (**35 s**, or `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS`); localhost CDP probes use **1000 ms** each (`ELECTRON_CDP_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/electron/cdp.ts`) |
| `cleanup` | Applied separately to managed-session `close` and the initial tracked-process exit wait; not a deadline for debug-port checks or profile removal | `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_IMPLICIT_SESSION_CLOSE_TIMEOUT_MS` when set, else **5000 ms** (`getImplicitSessionCloseTimeoutMs` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/runtime.ts`, passed through `cleanupTrackedElectronHostLaunches` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/orchestration/electron-host/index.ts`) |
| `probe` | **Each** upstream read: optional `get cdp-url` verification, then `get url`, `get title`, focused `eval --stdin`, `tab list`, and `snapshot -i` | Same wrapper subprocess default (**35 s**, or `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS`, from `getAgentBrowserProcessTimeoutMs` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/process.ts`) |

## `qa.attached` — current-session smoke check

`qa` has two forms: the URL form (`qa: { url, … }`) and the attached form (`qa: { attached: true, … }`). The attached form is the right tool for Electron smoke checks after either launch path because it does not open a URL and runs all checks against the current managed session.

```json
{
  "qa": {
    "attached": true,
    "expectedText": "Explorer",
    "expectedSelector": "@e1",
    "checkConsole": true,
    "checkErrors": true,
    "screenshotPath": ".dogfood/electron.png"
  }
}
```

`qa.attached` rejects `url` and is incompatible with `sessionMode: "fresh"` — attach first with `electron.launch` or raw `connect`, then run `qa.attached`. Preserved-buffer diagnostics (`checkConsole`, `checkErrors`, `checkNetwork`) default to `false` for attached QA; opt into them when you want historical session buffers to fail the smoke. The full field rules and pass/fail classification live in [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md#qa`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#qa).

In attached Electron sessions, broad selectors such as `body`, `html`, `main`, or `[role=application]` can read the entire app shell. When `get text <selector>` looks too broad, the wrapper may attach `details.electronGetTextScopeWarning` and a `snapshot-for-electron-text-scope` next action; prefer a fresh `snapshot -i`, a current `@ref`, or a narrower panel selector.

## `sourceLookup` against packaged Electron apps

`sourceLookup` is an experiment for hinting at the source file/component behind a visible element. It is **opt-in** and **evidence-based**: it reports confidence and evidence rather than claiming a guaranteed mapping. The same experimental helper works against packaged Electron apps, but with two important boundaries:

1. **Scope of the workspace scan.** `sourceLookup` walks the Pi session **cwd** (default `maxWorkspaceFiles: 2000`, hard cap 5000). It does **not** unpack `app.asar` or installed app resources. For packaged apps where the source lives inside `Contents/Resources/app.asar`, the workspace-search lane will commonly return no candidates.
2. **React DevTools requirement.** `react inspect <id>` requires the session to have been launched with `--enable react-devtools` before first navigation. For Electron, the wrapper's `electron.launch` path does **not** inject `--enable react-devtools` into the Electron process; that flag belongs to upstream `agent-browser` Chromium launches. If the Electron app does not already expose a React DevTools backend, expect `react inspect` to fail; DOM-attribute and workspace-search candidates may still surface.

For wrapper-tracked packaged Electron sessions where `status` is `no-candidates`, the wrapper attaches `workspaceRoot` plus optional `electronContext` (`launchId?`, `appName?`, `appPath?`, `executablePath?`, `sessionName?`, `url?`) and limitations explaining the bundle/asar boundary, plus `snapshot-electron-session`, `probe-electron-launch`, and `list-electron-tabs` next actions so you can inspect the live app and decide whether to widen the workspace or pull source out-of-band before re-running the lookup.

```json
{ "sourceLookup": { "selector": "#save", "reactFiberId": "2", "componentName": "SaveButton" } }
```

Treat `sourceLookup` output as a starting point for navigation, not a substitute for reading code. Full contract: [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md#sourcelookup`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#sourcelookup).

## Safety and ownership

Remote debugging exposes app content (DOM, network, JavaScript) to the attached browser tool. The wrapper ships **isolation defaults**; it does **not** classify any app as too-risky-to-launch.

### What the wrapper always does

- Launches with `--user-data-dir=<wrapper-created-temp>` and `--remote-debugging-port=0`.
- Reads the OS-chosen port from `DevToolsActivePort`.
- Adds `--disable-extensions`, `--no-first-run`, and `--no-default-browser-check` alongside sanitized caller `appArgs`.
- Rejects `appArgs` that try to override lifecycle/debug flags.
- Refuses to launch non-Electron targets (correctness gate, not a security gate).
- Treats `electron.cleanup` as wrapper-owned only; never touches manually launched apps.

### What the **caller** owns

- The decision to launch or attach to a sensitive app in the first place.
- Optional `allow` / `deny` policy lists when you want guardrails.
- Profile and process cleanup for manually launched apps.
- Host-file cleanup for any explicit screenshots, downloads, HARs, traces, or recordings saved to caller-chosen paths. `electron.cleanup` does not touch these.

### Caller-owned policy: `allow` / `deny`

Both lists match `appName`, `bundleId`, `desktopId`, `appPath`, or `executablePath` by substring.

```json
{
  "electron": {
    "action": "launch",
    "appName": "Slack",
    "allow": ["Slack"],
    "deny": ["1Password", "Bitwarden"]
  }
}
```

Rules:

- If `allow` is set, the target must match at least one entry.
- If `deny` is set, a matching target is rejected.
- `deny` wins on conflict.
- With neither set, launch is permitted.

Policy mismatches fail with `failureCategory: "policy-blocked"` and `details.electron.failure.policy` names the matched list and entry.

### Likely-sensitive annotations

`electron.list` may annotate common private-data apps (`notes`, `chat`, `mail`, `developer-workspace`, `passwords-auth`) with `sensitivity.level: "likely-sensitive"` and a visible `[likely sensitive: …]` marker. These are **advisory hints only**. They do not block `launch` and they do not replace caller `allow` / `deny`.

## Failure categories and recovery

`details.failureCategory` values you should expect from Electron flows, with the recovery move:

| Category | When | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `validation-error` | Bad input (missing target, conflicting fields, non-Electron target) | Fix the request; the message names the problem |
| `policy-blocked` | Caller `allow` / `deny` rejected the launch | Adjust the policy or pick a different target |
| `timeout` | `DevToolsActivePort` never appeared in time | Inspect `details.electron.failure.diagnostics` (PID, profile path, port file state, elapsed/timeout); retry with a higher `timeoutMs` if the app legitimately needs more time |
| `upstream-error` | Launch/attach/spawn/CDP failure that does not fit a more specific bucket | Inspect `details.electron.failure.diagnostics`; the app may be missing dependencies or hitting a CDP race |
| `tab-drift` | A successful-looking command was followed by a dead process / debug port / unrecoverable `about:blank` | Use the appended `status-electron-launch` / `probe-electron-launch` next actions, then decide whether to relaunch |
| `cleanup-failed` | Cleanup only partially succeeded | Inspect `details.electron.cleanup.results[].steps` for remaining process/port/profile state; `retry-electron-cleanup` references the same `launchId` |
| `stale-ref` | `@e…` ref reused after a navigation/rerender | Take a fresh `snapshot -i` (or follow `refresh-electron-refs-after-rerender` when the wrapper appends it) |

Failed startup diagnostics include `outputCaptured`, `stdoutTail` / `stderrTail`, and `stdoutTruncated` / `stderrTruncated`. Each tail reads at most the last **4096 source bytes** before UTF-8 decoding and normal credential redaction, and appears in both visible failure text and structured details. Empty output is reported explicitly; `stdoutError` / `stderrError` report capture-read or close errors without replacing the original startup reason, exit status, or cleanup warning.

The app writes to mode-0600 `stdout.log` and `stderr.log` inside its isolated profile. These are regular files, not pipes to Pi, so retained apps can keep writing after reload or host exit. Logs follow profile preservation and removal; **the read limit is not a lifetime disk limit**. If failed-startup process cleanup cannot finish, the profile and logs are protected from general temp cleanup. Any failure to persist that protection appears alongside the original `failure.cleanupError`; in-memory protection remains. Use the reported PID and profile path to resolve that failed cleanup before removing files.

Single-instance Electron behavior is a common cause of `timeout` and `upstream-error`. Many Electron apps enforce a single running instance and silently drop a second invocation's `--remote-debugging-port` flag. If the app is already running without a debug port, quit it first or use the manual host-launch path against the existing instance instead.

## Troubleshooting

### Launch hangs and then times out
- The app is enforcing single-instance; quit the running copy first, then retry.
- The app may have moved its Electron framework directory; pass `executablePath` explicitly.
- `timeoutMs` is too short for a heavy app; raise it (`launch.timeoutMs` is bounded but generous).
- Read the redacted stdout/stderr tails in the failure text or `details.electron.failure.diagnostics` first; dependency and startup errors often explain the failure. `DevToolsActivePort`, port number, PID liveness, and timing provide the remaining context.

### `electron.list` returns nothing
- On Linux, the binary may be a custom rebrand without `chrome_*.pak` siblings, an AppImage without a `.desktop` entry, or a statically linked fork. Pass `executablePath` directly.
- On macOS, apps installed outside `/Applications` and `~/Applications` are not scanned in v1. Pass `appPath` or `executablePath` explicitly.
- Windows hosts report `platform: "unsupported"` from `electron.list`; always pass `executablePath` (or a resolvable `appPath`) for `launch`.

### Attach succeeds but `snapshot -i` returns no refs
- Some Electron apps take a beat to render. The default `handoff: "snapshot"` already retries briefly; if it still reports no refs, run `tab list`, select the intended stable `t<N>` app tab, then run `snapshot -i` again.
- For raw `connect`, do the same target check before assuming the signed-in app is ready; the attach can succeed before an active page is available.
- For apps whose UI lives in a webview, switch `targetType` to `"webview"` or `"any"` so the wrapper attaches to the right CDP target.

### "I clicked, but nothing happened"
- A successful upstream `click` means the action was dispatched, not that the app handled it. Re-snapshot, check `details.pageChangeSummary`, or use `qa.attached` to verify.
- Electron apps frequently rerender in place (no URL change). The wrapper may attach `refresh-electron-refs-after-rerender` to remind you to re-snapshot before reusing `@e…` refs.

### `fill` looks fine but the field is empty
- Custom quick-input controls (VS Code's quick-pick, command palette, etc.) often need focus + keyboard typing rather than a direct `fill`. The wrapper attaches `details.fillVerification` when `get value` disagrees with the requested text; follow `inspect-after-fill-verification` and switch to focus + `keyboard type` before submitting.

### `get text` returns the whole app
- Broad selectors (`body`, `html`, `main`, `[role=application]`) read the entire shell. Use a current `@ref` or a narrower panel selector. The wrapper attaches `details.electronGetTextScopeWarning` and a `snapshot-for-electron-text-scope` next action when it detects this pattern.

### `sourceLookup` says `no-candidates` for a packaged app
- Expected when the app's source lives inside `app.asar`. The wrapper does not unpack bundles. Use `electron.probe` / `snapshot-electron-session` / `list-electron-tabs` next actions to inspect the live UI, or pull source separately into the Pi session cwd before re-running the lookup.

### Mismatch between `status` and the active session
- `electron.status` may report a live wrapper launch while the managed session has drifted to `about:blank`. Follow `reattach-electron-launch`, then refresh refs before reusing old `@e…` handles. For non-wrapper tab drift where `details.nextActions` names `select-intended-tab-after-drift`, use that stable `t<N>` action plus `snapshot-after-tab-recovery` before continuing.

## Cleanup checklist

Before ending the task:

- Call `electron.cleanup` (or `electron.cleanup` with `all: true`) for every wrapper-owned `launchId` you started. The result reports per-step state for `managed-session`, `process`, `debug-port`, and `user-data-dir`.
- Confirm `details.electron.cleanup.summary` does not list remaining resources.
- For **manually launched** apps, close the app yourself and clean any profile or temp files you created. `electron.cleanup` will not (and should not) touch them.
- Remove any explicit screenshots, recordings, downloads, PDFs, traces, or HAR files you saved to caller-chosen paths. Artifact cleanup is host-owned; the wrapper only reports them under `details.artifacts` and `details.artifactCleanup`.

If `cleanup` returns `failureCategory: "cleanup-failed"`, inspect `details.electron.cleanup.results[].steps` and use `retry-electron-cleanup` for the same `launchId`. Do not invent new cleanup commands for processes the wrapper did not start.

## Verification

- Fake-upstream Electron discovery/lifecycle tests cover list/launch/status/probe/cleanup without a real app.
- Real-app validation is a manual `tmux` smoke pass per `AGENTS.md`. Electron is a narrow typed lifecycle (`list`/`launch`/`status`/`probe`/`cleanup`) adopted because agents repeatedly failed the manual discover→debug-port→attach→cleanup sequence; it is not a generic recipe runtime (`RQ-0068` / `RQ-0096`).

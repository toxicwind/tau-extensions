## Purpose

Provide a local, repo-readable command reference for the native `agent_browser` tool.

This project intentionally blocks normal `agent-browser` bash usage in most agent sessions, so the agent still needs an accessible local equivalent of the upstream command surface. This document is the durable reference the agent can read inside the repository without calling the binary directly.

After updating `pi-agent-browser-native`, fully quit and restart Pi before using the updated tools. `/reload` can retain previously loaded compiled JavaScript even after `dist/` is rebuilt, so it is not a reliable way to pick up package updates.

SDK hosts can supply an awaited [`beforeExecute` callback](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#host-execution-hook) to save host state before ordinary or script-inner browser dispatch. This is a factory option, not a tool argument; normal installations do not need it.

## Upstream baseline

<!-- agent-browser-capability-baseline:start upstream-baseline -->
<!-- Generated from scripts/agent-browser-capability-baseline.mjs. Run `npm run docs -- command-reference write` to update. Do not edit manually. -->
This reference is baselined to the locally installed `agent-browser 0.37.0` command/help surface, audited against vercel-labs/agent-browser@471ab3852b47b98847f1d9c855c272bb62d0d50b. Upstream `agent-browser` remains the source of truth for command semantics; this file is the local fallback for Pi agent sessions where direct binary help is blocked or discouraged.

The lightweight drift check is `npm run verify -- command-reference`. Run it whenever the installed upstream `agent-browser` version changes or this reference is edited.

### Upstream 0.37.0 rebaseline

The recommended release keeps the stable 0.35.0 floor and no upper version cap.

- `record start` / `record restart` accept command-local `--fps <n>` before, between or after path/URL operands (1–60, default 30). WebM uses VP8/libvpx; MP4 uses H.264/libx264. Other extensions are handed to ffmpeg; extensionless paths are rejected. Native startup validates the path, rate and ffmpeg availability.
- Recording uses the current active page without replacing its DOM/JavaScript state unless a URL is supplied. The wrapper still conservatively requires a fresh snapshot after dispatched starts and URL-bearing restarts to protect older supported natives; this is not evidence that a page changed. FPS alone neither chooses another tab nor makes a restart invalidate refs.
- Successful navigation may advertise page-provided WebMCP tools. The wrapper shows the native positive hint and retains `data.webmcp`; absent, unavailable or empty results add no hint.
- Native `tab new` and `click --new-tab` apply session user agent, headers, HTTP credentials, init scripts, routes and emulation before the first document loads. The wrapper adds no tab-setup engine.

### Upstream 0.36.0 rebaseline

The 0.36.0 release adds experimental page-provided WebMCP tools while preserving the stable 0.35.0 runtime floor.

- `webmcp list` discovers tools registered by the current page. `webmcp invoke <tool>` accepts JSON or file input, frame selection, detached execution, and a timeout; `webmcp result <id>` waits for a detached call and `webmcp cancel <id>` cancels one.
- Locally managed Chrome enables WebMCP by default. `--no-webmcp`, `AGENT_BROWSER_NO_WEBMCP`, and upstream config `noWebmcp` disable it; attached browsers, remote providers, Lightpanda, Safari/iOS, and older Chrome builds may return `webmcp_unsupported` instead. The wrapper treats `--no-webmcp` as launch-scoped.
- `webmcp list` is read-only. Because `invoke`, `result`, and `cancel` can run page code that mutates, rerenders, or navigates, the wrapper rechecks the live page and invalidates prior page-scoped refs. A detached call that remains pending keeps the page target unverified, as does a failed `result` / `cancel` attempt while that target is unknown; settle or cancel it successfully, or use the `verify-page-target-after-pending-webmcp` (`get url`) next action / explicit navigation before taking a fresh snapshot. In `batch --bail`, put `get url` between a completed WebMCP mutation and `snapshot -i`.
- `skills get webmcp-gen` loads the bundled workflow for creating `webmcp.init.js` and validating it against the existing UI. External MCP clients can opt into page tools with `mcp --tools core,webmcp`; the native Pi wrapper continues to use direct `args` rather than starting an MCP server.
- Upstream also updates its separate Eve integration, dependency resolutions, and Lightpanda launch arguments. This wrapper adds no Eve layer or compatibility shim.

### Upstream 0.35.2 rebaseline

Upstream 0.35.2 hardens the standalone dashboard against DNS rebinding and cross-origin access. `dashboard start --allowed-origins <origins>` accepts comma-separated exact HTTPS reverse-proxy origins, with `AGENT_BROWSER_DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` as the environment equivalent; the wrapper keeps this local lifecycle command sessionless. The release also fixes root remote CDP WebSocket URLs that contain query strings without requiring a wrapper shim.

### Upstream 0.35.1 rebaseline

The 0.35.1 baseline is a bug-fix release with no new commands or flags. Browser-backed calls accept stable `agent-browser` versions at or above the 0.35.0 floor.

- Snapshot diffs reset element-ref numbering for each diff, invalidate refs across URL navigation, and preserve previous refs when a diff fails.
- Stream URL events now follow the active main frame across full-document, History API, fragment, and active-tab changes while ignoring child frames and background tabs.
- The Windows ARM64 launcher prefers a native executable and falls back to the published x64 binary through Windows emulation.
- `rustls-webpki` and `quinn-proto` received upstream dependency updates.

### Upstream 0.35.0 rebaseline

The 0.35.0 release is the current runtime floor and adds private proxy CA trust plus one bundled workflow skill.

- `--ca-cert <path>` / `AGENT_BROWSER_CA_CERT` loads a PEM bundle or DER certificate into an isolated NSS trust store for locally launched Linux Chromium. Normal hostname, validity, and unrelated-authority checks remain enabled. Equivalent certificate content reuses Chromium; changed content relaunches it. `--no-ca-cert` / `AGENT_BROWSER_CLEAR_CA_CERT` clears retained trust.
- Use CA trust only with a fresh managed session. The wrapper treats `--ca-cert` and `--no-ca-cert` as launch-scoped for managed-session planning, disables automatic managed restore when CA trust is enabled, and passes caller-selected certificate paths through unchanged. Upstream rejects CA trust with profiles, CDP/auto-connect, providers, Lightpanda, `--ignore-https-errors`, macOS, or Windows, and requires `certutil` (`install --with-deps` installs it on supported Linux systems).
- `skills get protected-vercel-deployments --full` loads the bundled short-lived Trusted Sources OIDC workflow. It uses `vc project token` and the `x-vercel-trusted-oidc-idp-token` header, avoids persisting tokens, and hands dashboard-only access-control changes to an authorized human.
- The release also restores ARM64 build artifacts; no wrapper shim is needed.

### Upstream 0.34.0 rebaseline

The 0.34.0 release added persistent session-to-tab binding for shared Chrome sessions. It is below the current 0.35.0 runtime floor: before browser-backed work, the extension caches one `agent-browser --version` check per cwd/PATH and fails below-floor or malformed versions with expected/observed version details. Plain help/version, close recovery, and sessionless local setup/diagnostics remain available.

- Named sessions on `--cdp` or `--auto-connect` remember their CDP target across commands and daemon restarts. CDP target ids from `tab list --json` are accepted as tab refs and stay stable across daemon restarts, unlike `t<N>` ids.
- `--pin-tab` (`AGENT_BROWSER_PIN_TAB`) is sticky per session and is not launch-scoped: pass it once, including on an already-live session, so a closed bound tab fails with `tab_gone` instead of adopting a neighbor. JSON includes `code=tab_gone`, `data.targetId`, and optional sanitized `data.lastUrl`; batch exposes the same recovery object under `result`. Recover with `tab new` or `tab list`. `--no-pin-tab` turns the pin off again. Optional booleans use separated tokens (`--pin-tab false`).
- This wrapper classifies `tab_gone` as `failureCategory: "tab-gone"` and returns `list-tabs-after-tab-gone` plus `open-tab-after-tab-gone`. `tab list` presentation includes `target=<id>` when upstream reports `data.targetId`.
- Doctor no longer hangs on Chrome version detection. The Remote Agent Browser provider guide is upstream documentation only; this wrapper adds no new provider mode.

### Upstream 0.33.2 rebaseline

The 0.33.1–0.33.2 releases harden daemon lifecycle and live streaming without new core page commands. Package 0.4.1 targeted exactly `agent-browser 0.33.2`: before browser-backed work, the extension caches one `agent-browser --version` check per cwd/PATH and fails a mismatch with expected/observed version details. Plain help/version, close recovery, and sessionless local setup/diagnostics remain available.

- 0.33.1 ships a default daemon idle timeout of 1 hour (`AGENT_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, default `3600000`; `0` disables). Sessions without a restore key discard transient cookies/tabs on idle shutdown. Headed, Safari/iOS WebDriver, and user-attached browsers are exempt from that default. Tab recovery also revives Memory Saver-discarded tabs on connect/switch/close and reports recovery fields such as `revived` / `dialogBlocked` / `activeTabRevived`.
- 0.33.2 makes stream frame delivery latest-wins, prioritizes input over frame writes, adds per-client `maxFps` / ack pacing, and adds `AGENT_BROWSER_STREAM_QUALITY`, `AGENT_BROWSER_STREAM_MAX_WIDTH`, and `AGENT_BROWSER_STREAM_MAX_HEIGHT` for screencast bandwidth control.
- This wrapper keeps its managed-session idle override and enables transcript- and checkout-scoped `AGENT_BROWSER_RESTORE` for wrapper-owned implicit sessions so browser state can survive relaunch, reload, and `/resume`; set `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_MANAGED_SESSION_RESTORE=0` to disable it. Explicit sessions, restore/state paths, config, file access, launch arguments, environment, local pages, and close arguments pass through unchanged. Session/state lists keep every upstream row and restore identifier visible. Managed daemon inspection only coordinates the wrapper's automatic restore lifecycle.

### Upstream 0.33.0 rebaseline

The 0.32.3–0.33.0 releases add HAR body capture, fix semantic locators, and ship accessibility audits:

- 0.32.3 embeds text response bodies in HAR captures by default and adds `network har start --content <mode>` with `text` (default), `all`, and `none`. It also ships the `derive-client` skill for recording traffic and generating a standalone API client from HAR data.
- 0.32.4 makes `find role` match implicit ARIA roles and browser-computed accessible names (for example `find role heading text --name` against `<h2>`, lists, and banners), keeps case-insensitive substring name matching by default, preserves locator detail in element-not-found errors (`Names seen: …`), and aligns advertised `find` actions to `click, fill, check, hover, text`.
- 0.33.0 adds `a11y [url]` axe-core accessibility audits (`--tags`, `--selector`, structured JSON) with an embedded offline engine, plus a native fix that revives discarded tabs on tab switch instead of hanging the daemon.

This wrapper classifies 0.32.4+ locator-detail misses as `selector-not-found`, treats HAR `--content` and a11y `--tags` as command-scoped value flags, renders compact `a11y` summaries, and documents the skill/HAR/a11y surfaces. No Eve-specific Pi runtime is added.

### Upstream 0.32.2 rebaseline

The 0.32.1 and 0.32.2 releases only update the separate `@agent-browser/eve` integration; the CLI/help/schema surface is unchanged:

- 0.32.1 standardized lowercase eve branding and widened compatibility beyond the original pinned peer range.
- 0.32.2 targets eve 0.25.1+, adopts eve's source/dist extension manifest, updates its example to stable AI SDK packages, and aligns tests with eve's scoped config registry.
- This Pi extension still does not bundle `@agent-browser/eve` or add an eve-specific input mode.

The current audit also closes a command-reference/presentation gap for upstream `read [url]`, which has existed since 0.30.0: the capability baseline now samples `read --help`, native results render `data.content` instead of only the fetched URL, explicit fetch metadata cannot replace the active browser tab target, and `read --timeout <ms>` extends the wrapper subprocess budget across upstream's per-request `.md` and ancestor-`llms.txt` fallback sequence.

### Upstream 0.32.0 rebaseline

The 0.32.0 rebaseline hardens domain containment and fixes completed-page waits without adding a new native Pi input mode:

- `--allowed-domains <list>` now contains request traffic across pages, iframes, workers, service workers, shared workers, and popups. Chromium `RTCPeerConnection` is disabled while containment is active to prevent WebRTC bypasses.
- The wrapper treats argv-supplied `--allowed-domains` as launch-scoped. Use `sessionMode: "fresh"` for a fresh local Chrome context; upstream owns containment and incompatible-mode rejection, and the wrapper passes its result through unchanged.
- `wait --load load` and `wait --load domcontentloaded` now resolve immediately when the current document already reached the requested state instead of waiting for a future lifecycle event. The wrapper still treats `waited:timeout` as inconclusive rather than success.
- Upstream also publishes `@agent-browser/eve`, a separate Eve extension with namespaced browser tools and sandbox helpers. It is not bundled by this Pi extension and does not change the native `agent_browser` schema.

### Upstream 0.31.2 rebaseline

The 0.31.2 rebaseline adds a WebGPU launch preset and periodic restore-state autosaves:

- `--webgpu` (also `AGENT_BROWSER_WEBGPU`; upstream config accepts `"webgpu": true`) enables the upstream platform preset. Native calls preserve project/user config plus explicit `--config` and `AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG`. It uses Metal on macOS, D3D on Windows, and SwiftShader software Vulkan on Linux. The Pi wrapper treats it as launch-scoped, so use `sessionMode: "fresh"` after an implicit session exists; `--webgpu false` explicitly disables a config/environment default.
- WebGPU requires a local browser launch. Upstream rejects enabled WebGPU with `--cdp`, `--auto-connect`, or `-p` / `--provider`. Use `doctor --webgpu` to pixel-check rendering and screenshot capture; use `doctor --webgpu --headed` when validating the headed capture path.
- Headless WebGPU screenshots work on macOS. Upstream documents black headless WebGPU canvas captures on Windows and Linux even when in-page rendering succeeds; Windows needs a logged-in headed desktop, while Linux can use `--headed` with automatic Xvfb unless `AGENT_BROWSER_NO_XVFB=1`. Linux software rendering also needs `libvulkan1` and `mesa-vulkan-drivers`.
- Restore-enabled sessions now save periodically while the browser remains open, including idle page-driven cookie/storage changes. `AGENT_BROWSER_AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL_MS` defaults to `30000`; `0` disables periodic saves but keeps native close saves. The existing `--restore-save` policy still controls whether automatic saves are allowed. For wrapper-owned headed launches, this extension defaults the interval to `0` because upstream 0.33.2 collects multi-origin storage through visible temporary tabs; upstream exempts headed browsers from idle shutdown, so direct window close can lose newer state unless an explicit interval was set before launch. The wrapper retains the effective launch-time interval across resume and rejects changes in either direction on a running wrapper-owned headed daemon until close plus a fresh launch.
- Upstream MCP `open` and `doctor` tools now expose typed WebGPU fields. This Pi extension keeps `args` as the thin CLI-parity path; `mcp --help` remains sessionless, while bare long-running MCP server startup is intentionally rejected in a one-shot Pi tool call.

### Upstream 0.31.1 rebaseline

The 0.31.1 rebaseline is a React bugfix release: `react tree`, `react inspect <id>`, and `react suspense` now pick the `react-dom` renderer with mounted fiber roots instead of hardcoding renderer id `1`. This fixes empty React trees on Next.js 16.3 / Turbopack / RSC pages. No CLI/help/schema surface changed, so the wrapper only updates baseline evidence and keeps the 0.31.0 restore/session handling below.

### Upstream 0.31.0 rebaseline

The 0.31.0 rebaseline adds restore workflow and namespace/session lifecycle surfaces: `--restore [name]`, `--restore-save <policy>`, restore check flags, `--namespace <name>`, `session id`, and `session info`. The wrapper parses those globals, keeps `--namespace` before `--session`, carries namespace context through managed-session probes and state, and keeps `session id` / `session info` sessionless. Use `agent_browser` with `args: ["session", "id", "--scope", "worktree", "--prefix", "my-skill"]` to derive reusable session ids from inside Pi; use `--restore=<key>` when passing an explicit key that could be confused with a command word.

Runtime probes retain the 0.30.1 `wait --url` fix: `wait --url "**/dashboard"` succeeds after a `pushstate /dashboard`, so `job.assertUrl` delegates exact and glob patterns to upstream `wait --url`. Upstream 0.32.4 aligns advertised `find` actions with the dispatcher: `click, fill, check, hover, text` only—use top-level `uncheck <selector-or-ref>` (and `type` / `focus`) instead of `find ... uncheck|type|focus`. One older caveat still stands: `wait <selector> --state hidden|detached` remains advertised by some help paths but fails at runtime, so keep `wait --fn` disappearance guidance.

### Upstream 0.29.1 rebaseline

The 0.29.1 rebaseline added no new core browser CLI commands. It captured upstream's new hosted-sandbox helper package and install behavior:

- `@agent-browser/sandbox` is the upstream helper package for Eve and Vercel Sandbox workflows. It is not bundled by this pi extension; load `skills get vercel-sandbox --full` when a task needs that hosted-sandbox guidance.
- Fresh Eve and Vercel Sandbox helpers install Chromium system dependencies by default; pass `installSystemDependencies: false` only when the sandbox image already has those libraries.
- `install --with-deps` exits nonzero when the package manager cannot install required browser libraries (`install --with-deps exits nonzero`).

### Upstream 0.28.0 rebaseline

The 0.28.0 rebaseline tracks new local/infra upstream surfaces and does not change core browser-command semantics. New agent-facing surface captured by the capability baseline:

- `mcp` starts a local MCP stdio server exposing agent-browser tools. It is intended for external MCP clients that spawn `agent-browser mcp` as a subprocess; an agent inside pi would not normally invoke it, and the wrapper treats it as sessionless (no managed browser session injected).
- `plugin add <ref>`, `plugin [list]`, `plugin show <name>`, and `plugin run <name> <type>` manage configured plugins in `agent-browser.json` (added from npm or GitHub); all are sessionless in the wrapper.
- `auth login <name> --credential-provider <plugin>` resolves credentials just-in-time from a configured credential plugin (for example, a vault); credentials are not saved locally.
- `AGENT_BROWSER_PLUGINS` is a JSON plugin registry override.

The wrapper adds no compatibility shim for older upstream releases.

### Upstream 0.27.3 install-only rebaseline

The 0.27.3 rebaseline is an install-only compatibility update: upstream changed Windows ARM64 installation fallback behavior and did not change the CLI/help surface or browser-command semantics. This wrapper adds no compatibility shim for older upstream releases. The wrapper must still not hide these prior upstream fixes:

- click reliability: upstream now scrolls off-viewport elements before coordinate resolution, handles JavaScript dialogs promptly, recovers mouse state after dialog-opening clicks, and reports overlay interception before dispatching input
- frame-scoped CSS selectors and waits, including cross-process iframe click-coordinate translation
- wait timeout handling: documented 25s default, honored `--timeout` across wait variants, and appropriate client read budgets for long waits; the native wrapper forwards explicit long waits and derives a subprocess watchdog when top-level `timeoutMs` is omitted
- form commands: `find label` matches `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby`, `select` errors when no option matches, and `type` parses `--clear` / `--delay` instead of typing them as literal text
- warm CLI command latency and batch daemon respawn/retry improvements
- GNU Linux release artifacts pinned to glibc 2.28

## Core mental model

Input mode chooser (one per call): **`script`** for one-shot loops, branches, or multi-page aggregation; **`args`** for the default open → snapshot -i → click/fill `@refs` flow; **`semanticAction`** for stable role/text/label targets; **`job`** / **`qa`** for multi-step checks; **`electron`** for desktop apps only; **`sourceLookup`** / **`networkSourceLookup`** are **experimental candidates-only** helpers (not authoritative mappings). Do not pass `--json` in `args`—the wrapper injects it. Match link and button text to the latest snapshot (on `https://example.com/` the main link is `Learn more`, not legacy `More information...` copy). See [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#input-mode-chooser) for snapshot variants (`-i` vs `--compact` vs full) and batching three or more getters.

Tool parameters (use exactly one of `script`, `args`, `semanticAction`, `job`, `qa`, `sourceLookup`, `networkSourceLookup`, or `electron`):

```json
{ "script": "const page = await browser({ args: ['get', 'title'] }); if (!page.ok) throw new Error(page.error); emit(page.data.title ?? page.data.result);" }
```

```json
{ "args": ["open", "https://example.com"], "sessionMode": "auto" }
```

```json
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "click", "locator": "text", "value": "Submit" }, "sessionMode": "auto" }
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "fill", "selector": "@e1", "text": "prompt text" } }
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "select", "selector": "#flavor", "value": "chocolate" } }
```

```json
{ "args": ["batch"], "stdin": "[[\"open\",\"https://example.com\"],[\"snapshot\",\"-i\"]]" }
```

```json
{ "job": { "steps": [{ "action": "open", "url": "https://example.com" }, { "action": "assertText", "text": "Example Domain" }] } }
```

```json
{ "sourceLookup": { "selector": "#save", "reactFiberId": "2", "componentName": "SaveButton" } }
```

```json
{ "networkSourceLookup": { "requestId": "req-1", "url": "/api/fail" } }
```

```json
{ "electron": { "action": "list", "query": "code" } }
{ "electron": { "action": "launch", "appName": "Visual Studio Code", "handoff": "snapshot" } }
```

- `script`: one-shot sandboxed async JavaScript with `browser({ args, stdin?, timeoutMs? })` and `emit(value)`. Use it for loops, conditional page branches, or aggregation only; every invocation gets a unique non-profile session, clears ambient upstream launch controls, closes afterward, and has no host APIs or reusable-name/state surface.
- `args`: exact `agent-browser` CLI tokens after the binary name. Omit when using `script`, `semanticAction`, `job`, `qa`, `sourceLookup`, `networkSourceLookup`, or `electron` instead (mutually exclusive).
- `semanticAction`: optional shorthand for common `find` flows, direct selector/ref click/check/fill, and native dropdown `select`; compiles to upstream argv and is rejected together with `args`, `job`, `qa`, `sourceLookup`, `networkSourceLookup`, or `electron` on the same call.
- `job`: optional constrained short-workflow schema; compiles to existing upstream `batch` args/stdin, defaults to `batch --bail` (`failFast: true`), and reports the compiled plan in `details.compiledJob`. Keep stateful jobs short around navigation, click, and rerender boundaries on dynamic apps.
- `qa`: optional lightweight QA preset; compiles to the same fail-fast batch path and reports `details.compiledQaPreset` plus `details.qaPreset` pass/fail evidence.
- `sourceLookup`: **EXPERIMENTAL — candidates only** for local UI-to-source hints; compiles to the same `batch` path, reports `details.compiledSourceLookup` and `details.sourceLookup`, and never reclassifies a fully successful upstream batch as failed the way `qa` can (see [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#sourcelookup) and the longer notes below).
- `networkSourceLookup`: **EXPERIMENTAL — candidates only** for failed request-to-source hints; compiles to generated `batch`, reports `details.compiledNetworkSourceLookup` and `details.networkSourceLookup`, and never assigns blame or edits files.
- `electron`: optional Electron desktop-app shorthand. `list`, `status`, `cleanup`, and `probe` are wrapper-owned host/session helpers; `launch` starts a wrapper-owned isolated Electron profile and attaches through upstream `connect`.
- `stdin`: top-level stdin is only for `batch`, `eval --stdin`, and `auth save --password-stdin`; other combinations are rejected before `agent-browser` is launched. `script` puts inner stdin on `browser({ stdin })`; `job`, `qa`, `sourceLookup`, `networkSourceLookup`, and `electron` generate or manage their own input.
- `outputPath`: optional wrapper-owned local file sink for successful results and recording receipts, including failed, pending, timed-out or recovered stops. Recording exports preserve an envelope with original attempt status and native receipt/verification (`details.outputFile.source: "recording-receipt"`); unrelated failed extractions remain unwritten. Use it for durable `eval`, `get`, `snapshot`, or diagnostic outputs, not as the destination for screenshots, downloads, recordings, or other browser artifacts; if the paths resolve to the same file, the browser artifact is preserved and the result-data write fails validation. If presentation compacted a large direct result, a result row, or the whole `batch`, the writer copies each full command-redacted pre-compaction value only from its matching live wrapper-manifest spill; if any required spill is unavailable or untrusted, it fails without writing compact metadata. `details.outputFile` reports the saved path and byte count. If caller argv includes upstream `--json`, the visible JSON content stays parseable and the save notice is only in `details.outputFile`.
- `timeoutMs`: optional per-call wrapper subprocess watchdog override in milliseconds for the requested browser CLI process. Managed-session policy inspection can independently consume up to 35 seconds before that process; this preflight is intentionally not shortened by `timeoutMs` because a busy but valid daemon must remain distinguishable from an unverifiable one.
- `sessionMode`:
  - Native configured `session` / `AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION` defaults select a caller-owned shared browser for ordinary calls, just like explicit `--session`, without requiring repeated flags. Such a selection wins over both modes and is not closed on Pi quit. See [shared browser defaults](../README.md#shared-browser-defaults).
  - `"auto"` reuses the extension-managed session when no native session is selected.
  - `"fresh"` rotates that managed session to a fresh upstream launch so launch-scoped flags (`--allowed-domains`, `--auto-connect`, `--args`, `--ca-cert`, `--no-ca-cert`, `--cdp`, `--enable`, `--executable-path`, `--webgpu`, `--init-script`, `--idle-timeout`, `--user-agent`, `--headed`, `--device`, `--namespace`, `--profile`, `--provider`, `-p`, `--restore`, `--restore-save`, `--restore-check-url`, `--restore-check-text`, `--restore-check-fn`, `--session-name`, `--state`) apply.
  - If a fresh launch fails or times out, read `details.managedSessionOutcome` for `preserved` vs `abandoned` (and related fields). A model-visible `Managed session outcome: …` line is appended for failing calls that used `sessionMode: "fresh"` and when automatic close of a replaced session fails; `"auto"` failures can still populate the struct without that extra line. If you explicitly close the current wrapper-managed session with `--session <name> close`, later default auto calls rotate to a new wrapper-generated session instead of reusing the closed name; repeated closes and branch restores keep those generated names monotonic.

### One-shot code mode

Use `script` when a loop, an optional page branch, or multi-page aggregation would otherwise require several top-level tool calls and artifact reads. Source runs as an async JavaScript body. Call `await browser({ args, stdin?, timeoutMs? })`, check its `{ ok, data, details?, error?, failureCategory?, nextActions?, resultCategory, successCategory?, summary, text }` envelope, then call `emit(value)` with the one JSON-compatible value the model needs. Inner calls still traverse the ordinary wrapper executor, including policy checks, redaction, presentation, compact-spill rehydration, artifacts, and timeouts.

```json
{
  "script": "const titles = []; for (const url of ['https://example.com', 'https://example.org']) { const opened = await browser({ args: ['open', url] }); if (!opened.ok) throw new Error(opened.error); const title = await browser({ args: ['get', 'title'] }); if (!title.ok) throw new Error(title.error); titles.push({ url, title: title.data.title ?? title.data.result }); } emit(titles);"
}
```

The wrapper serializes inner calls, caps them at 25, caps source/final JSON at 64 KiB, defaults the whole script to 120 seconds, and rejects more than 300 seconds. Final data is redacted, compact-serialized, and byte-checked again before presentation so nesting cannot amplify small JSON into unbounded prose. Inner summaries/text are bounded, complete envelopes are checked against the IPC cap, and script-visible browser `nextActions` retain only policy-compatible calls after the isolated identity prefix is removed. It launches a separate permissioned Node child with no imports, process, filesystem, network, timers, dynamic code generation, or host object/function references. `Promise.all` is allowed for local orchestration but does not make browser calls concurrent. Pi approval covers the one visible top-level input and may therefore authorize all 25 inner calls. The collapsed Pi tool row shows a bounded terminal-safe source preview with line breaks marked as `↵`; expand the row to inspect the full terminal-safe source before approval. JavaScript CR/U+2028/U+2029 line terminators remain visible newlines, and removed terminal/directional/zero-width controls become visible markers.

A script invocation uses a unique `piab-script-<uuid>` browser identity in an empty namespace with managed restore disabled. It cannot name or attach to sessions, pass `--config`, use profiles/providers/state/restore/raw launch mutation, issue lifecycle/sessionless/local commands, or nest `batch` or another top-level input mode. Every inner helper and cleanup process also clears ambient `AGENT_BROWSER_*` and standard proxy variables and uses an empty temporary native config to bypass HOME/project profile defaults before the wrapper reapplies its namespace, timeout, and compatibility values. It never replaces the implicit conversation browser and always closes its isolated session. Use ordinary `args` with a requested profile/attachment for authenticated state.

Pi persistence is required because the extension appends a strict model-invisible cleanup lease before the first inner browser launch. Pi branch changes, quit, and reload abort the script and await normal isolated-session cleanup before state restoration continues. A failed close is retried on the active branch after restart and returns `failureCategory: "cleanup-failed"` plus exact `details.scriptSession.closeCommandArgs` / `close-script-session-after-cleanup-failure`. Any rejected inner policy/validation call fails the top-level result even if source consumes its envelope. See [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#script) for the full schema, limits, result fields, rejected controls, and recovery semantics.

Code mode remains ad hoc: there is no name, registry, imported module, persistent workflow state, or versioned recipe. Keep recurring linear flows in `job`, `qa`, raw `batch`, or docs instead of building a script catalog.

### Debug, diff, stream, dashboard, and chat families

Upstream also exposes non-core families (`network`, `diff`, `trace` / `profiler` / `record`, `console` / `errors` / `a11y` / `highlight` / `inspect` / `clipboard`, `stream`, `dashboard`, `chat`, and related subcommands). The wrapper still owns argv planning, `--json`, managed sessions where applicable, artifact metadata, and model-facing presentation: structured results are compacted and scrubbed in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/results/presentation.ts`, and echoed argv uses the same `redactInvocationArgs` rules as core commands (see [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#details) for the field contract). Deterministic fake-upstream coverage for representative JSON shapes and redaction lives in `test/agent-browser.extension-validation.test.ts` under `agentBrowserExtension passes through non-core network debug diff stream dashboard and chat families`.

## Recommended workflow

Keep routine browser work simple: open a page, inspect it with `snapshot -i`, interact with current `@ref` values from that snapshot, then inspect again. Re-run `snapshot -i` after navigation, scrolling, rerendering, or other major DOM changes because refs can become stale.

### Normal browse flow

```json
{ "args": ["open", "https://example.com"] }
{ "args": ["snapshot", "-i", "--urls"] }
{ "args": ["click", "@e2"] }
{ "args": ["snapshot", "-i"] }
```

### Headed demo, WebGPU, and local-page checks

Use upstream's global `--headed` flag on the first launch when the user needs to watch the browser. Because headed/headless state belongs to the browser launch, use `sessionMode: "fresh"` when a managed session may already exist or when changing from a previous headless run.

```json
{ "args": ["--headed", "open", "https://example.com"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }
{ "args": ["screenshot", "/tmp/agent-browser-headed-check.png"] }
```

`--headed` is launch-scoped, including explicit `false`, so changing an active managed session between headed and headless requires `sessionMode: "fresh"`. Wrapper-owned headed launches default `AGENT_BROWSER_AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL_MS` to `0` to avoid upstream 0.33.2's visible temporary storage-collector tabs and related daemon-policy delays, and record the effective launch-time interval and reapply it to every helper/follow-up subprocess, still-owned off-current session, Electron cleanup close, and reload/resume so daemon configuration remains stable. Native close still saves, but direct window close can lose newer state because headed browsers are exempt from idle shutdown; set an explicit interval before launch when periodic preservation matters, and close then relaunch fresh to change an existing daemon.

For a WebGPU page, enable the launch preset before the first navigation. Treat it as local-launch-only and use a fresh managed session when changing an existing browser:

```json
{ "args": ["--webgpu", "open", "https://webgpu.github.io/webgpu-samples/?sample=helloTriangle"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }
{ "args": ["screenshot", "/tmp/webgpu.png"] }
```

Run `{ "args": ["doctor", "--webgpu"] }` before trusting a black or blank WebGPU capture. On Linux/Windows capture paths, use `doctor --webgpu --headed` and follow upstream's platform requirements; do not combine enabled WebGPU with `--cdp`, `--auto-connect`, or provider launches.

On a successful first/fresh local wrapper-managed headed launch, including a launch inside `batch`, whose upstream lifecycle proves a browser launched, `details.browserWindow` reports `{ mode: "headed", ownership: "wrapper-managed", sessionName, visibility: "unverified" }` and the result adds one visible login handoff. CDP, auto-connect, provider, and Electron attachments suppress this local-window claim. Treat it as headed-launch evidence, not proof that a window is visible on the user's display. Remote shells, containers, virtual framebuffers, or upstream/provider-owned browser hosts can still put the window somewhere the user cannot see. If visible, let the user complete the login and continue the same wrapper session with `sessionMode: "auto"`; otherwise gather evidence with `screenshot`, `tab list`, `get url`, or `snapshot -i`, then fix display/profile/provider setup.

For local fixtures, remember that `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are resolved from the browser host, which may differ from the shell that started a temporary HTTP server. `net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` on `http://localhost:<port>` usually means the browser could not reach that server, not that the page rendered blank. Use a host-reachable HTTP(S) address or a `file://` fixture when upstream browser settings allow it. Local paths, artifact destinations, and top-level `outputPath` are caller-owned and pass through normally.

For an explicit `--session`, content-bearing reads and interactions first run a session-scoped `get url`; missing or stale transcript page state is not trusted, and a failed probe stops the requested content command. Calls to the same canonical namespace/session are serialized through that probe and command. Nested `batch` steps remain unsupported; raw batch command strings mirror upstream's ASCII-space tokenizer, including quoting and backslash handling.

Temporary HTTP servers and their port/process lifecycle stay outside the native tool. Extension maintainers running real-upstream contract tests can reuse `startAgentBrowserContractFixtureServer()` in [`test/helpers/agent-browser-harness.ts`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-browser-native/blob/main/test/helpers/agent-browser-harness.ts) instead of ad-hoc `python3 -m http.server` processes.

### React, SPA, and Web Vitals flows

React introspection requires the React DevTools init hook to be installed before the page's first JavaScript runs. Launch or relaunch that browser session with `--enable react-devtools`; if the implicit session is already active, use `sessionMode: "fresh"`.

```json
{ "args": ["open", "--enable", "react-devtools", "https://example.com"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }
{ "args": ["react", "tree"] }
{ "args": ["react", "inspect", "<fiberId>"] }
{ "args": ["react", "renders", "start"] }
{ "args": ["react", "renders", "stop"] }
{ "args": ["react", "suspense", "--only-dynamic"] }
```

Use `vitals [url]` for Core Web Vitals plus React hydration timing when available, and `pushstate <url>` for client-side SPA navigation without a full reload:

```json
{ "args": ["vitals", "https://example.com"] }
{ "args": ["pushstate", "/dashboard?tab=settings"] }
```

For first-navigation setup, start on `about:blank`, then stage routes, cookies, or init scripts before navigating. The relevant current upstream surfaces are `network route <url> [--abort|--body <json>] [--resource-type <csv>]` and `cookies set --curl <file>`:

```json
{ "args": ["open"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }
{ "args": ["network", "route", "**/*.js", "--abort", "--resource-type", "script"] }
{ "args": ["cookies", "set", "--curl", "/path/to/cookies.txt", "--domain", "example.com"] }
{ "args": ["navigate", "https://example.com"] }
```

### Selector strategy

Prefer targets in this order:

1. Use a current `@ref` from the latest `snapshot -i` for visible interactive controls.
2. After `scroll`, `scrollintoview`, navigation, or any rerender, take a fresh `snapshot -i` before reusing refs.
3. When a target is easiest to describe by accessible name or visible text, use `find` locators such as `role`, `text`, `label`, `placeholder`, `alt`, `title`, or `testid` instead of guessing selector syntax.
4. Use CSS selectors for scoped extraction or stable app-specific hooks when you know they match the current page.

Examples:

```json
{ "args": ["find", "role", "button", "click", "--name", "Close"] }
{ "args": ["find", "text", "Close", "click"] }
{ "args": ["find", "label", "Email", "fill", "user@example.com"] }
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "click", "locator": "role", "value": "button", "name": "Close" } }
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "click", "locator": "role", "role": "button", "name": "Continue without Signing In" } }
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "fill", "locator": "label", "value": "Email", "text": "user@example.com" } }
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "fill", "selector": "@e1", "text": "prompt text" } }
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "click", "selector": "#submit" } }
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "select", "selector": "#flavor", "value": "chocolate" } }
{ "semanticAction": { "action": "click", "locator": "text", "value": "Close", "session": "named-browser" } }
{ "args": ["scrollintoview", "@e12"] }
{ "args": ["snapshot", "-i"] }
```

The optional native `semanticAction` object is only a thin schema for common locator-based actions, direct selector/ref click/check/fill, and native dropdown selection; it compiles click/check/fill locator actions to existing upstream `find` commands, direct selector/ref actions to `click` / `check` / `fill`, and direct `action: "select"` to upstream `select <selector> <value...>`. Active-session role/name (`combobox` or `listbox`) and label select locators are resolved through one fresh snapshot to exactly one current visible ref before direct `select` execution; `details.compiledSemanticAction.args` reports that resolved `select @ref` argv (see [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#semanticaction) for the full field rules). For `locator: "role"`, pass either `value: "button"` or `role: "button"`; if both are present they must match. It is a top-level alternative to `script`, `args`, `job`, `qa`, `sourceLookup`, `networkSourceLookup`, and `electron`, not a nested shape inside `batch` stdin arrays. Add `session` inside `semanticAction` when the shorthand should target a named upstream browser session; the compiled argv prepends `--session <name>` before `find`, direct selector/ref commands, or `select`, and fallback candidate actions preserve that prefix. For active sessions, role/name click/check/fill shorthands may resolve through the current `snapshot -i` refs before execution so hidden duplicate matches do not steal the action; fill only resolves when there is one exact editable current ref match. Inspect `details.effectiveArgs` when you need the exact executed argv. `semanticAction` does not expose `uncheck` because upstream `find` actions are only `click, fill, check, hover, text`; use raw `uncheck <selector-or-ref>` after choosing a stable selector or current snapshot ref. If a raw `find` or semantic action misses with `selector-not-found`, the wrapper may take one fresh snapshot and append `Current snapshot ref fallback` when that snapshot has exact visible role/name matches for the failed target. Non-fill matches can include direct `try-current-visible-ref*` next actions. Semantic click misses may also include `Agent-browser candidate fallbacks`; `details.nextActions` first recommends a fresh `snapshot -i` and may include bounded role/name retries such as `button`/`link` for a missed `text` click, each as a `try-*-candidate` entry carrying redacted `find role …` argv.

For desktop, contenteditable, or host-controlled rich inputs, treat a semantic `fill` miss or mismatch differently. Active-session role/name fills can execute through one exact current editable `combobox`, `searchbox`, or `textbox` ref before upstream `find` runs. If a later selector miss still finds an exact current editable ref (`searchbox` or `textbox`), `details.richInputRecovery` and visible `Rich input recovery` describe the candidate and append `focus-current-editable-ref*` / `click-current-editable-ref*` next actions. Those actions deliberately do **not** copy the fill text and never press `Enter` or submit. Direct `fill @ref <text>` on contenteditable refs may also append/prepend instead of replacing; when the latest snapshot proves the target is contenteditable, the wrapper verifies `get text` after a successful fill and appends `details.fillVerification` plus `inspect-after-fill-verification` / `verify-filled-value` if the visible text does not match. Use the safe ladder instead: refresh refs, choose the current editable `@ref`, focus or click it, then use `keyboard type` for framework-controlled editors that require real key events. `keyboard inserttext` is paste-like: it can change a DOM value without updating application state, so use it only when later application-state evidence proves the edit was accepted. Do not auto-submit unless the user flow explicitly calls for it.

Do not assume Playwright selector dialects such as `text=Close` or `button:has-text('Close')` are supported wrapper syntax. In particular, current upstream can report successful `scrollintoview text=...` without moving the page, so the wrapper rejects that form before dispatch—directly or in an effective raw/stdin batch row—and shows executable `find text <label> hover` plus snapshot/ref recovery payloads in visible failure text and `details.nextActions`. `scrollintoview ... --help` and `-h` remain native help calls. Use `scrollintoview` with CSS, `xpath=...`, or a current `@e…` ref; use `find` for semantic text targets.

Treat `@eN`, `eN`, and `ref=eN` selector refs as page-scoped. Ref-looking fill/type text, select values, paths, and keyboard/mouse data remain literal. After a successful `snapshot`, the wrapper records the latest refs and page target for that session; getter or mutation ref commands such as `get text @e4`, `click @e4`, `select @e5 chocolate`, or batch steps with old refs fail with `failureCategory: "stale-ref"` when the page target changed or the ref is absent from the latest same-page snapshot. If a session `snapshot -i` fails with `No active page`, the wrapper invalidates prior refs for that session; later mutation-prone `@e…` calls fail before upstream until a successful fresh `snapshot -i` records refs again. Inside `batch` stdin JSON, the wrapper also walks steps in order before spawn: steps whose first token can navigate or mutate set a latch; a later step whose first token is `snapshot` clears that latch for following rows; guarded steps that still mention `@e…` after an uncleared latch fail with the same `stale-ref` bucket without launching upstream. Same-snapshot form fills and native form-control steps are allowed before a click or submit step, so `fill`, `check`/`uncheck` checkbox or radio refs, checkbox/radio `click`/`tap` refs, `select` combobox refs, then a final submit `click` can run from one snapshot. Split dynamic or autosubmit forms with a fresh snapshot if a control interaction rerenders the targets. Follow the `refresh-interactive-refs` next action (it includes `--session <name>` when needed) and prefer stable `find` or `semanticAction` locators when navigation or rerendering is likely. Contract detail: [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#details) (`refSnapshot`, `refSnapshotInvalidation`).

A successful `click` result means upstream reported a target, not that the app definitely handled the event. For top-level non-Electron direct clicks on `xpath=` targets and eligible current `@e…` refs, the wrapper installs a bounded target-specific DOM-event probe when it can; when upstream reports success but no trusted event reaches the resolved target, it fails the tool and exposes `details.clickDispatch` plus a `Click dispatch diagnostic` line with explicit retry/inspect next actions (no in-page click replay). Raw `find … click` locator calls are not probed because the wrapper has no concrete element before upstream resolves the locator, and document-level probes can falsely fail frame-scoped clicks. Direct `@e…` click probes are role-gated to current snapshot refs whose accessible role is `button`, `checkbox`, `menuitem`, `radio`, `switch`, or `tab`, with a unique role/name in both the saved snapshot and the live candidates. Duplicate-name refs pass through without a probe because their old ordinal does not prove target identity. If the probe evidence shows the target is outside a nested scroll container or viewport, `details.clickDispatch.scrollContainer` and `scroll-target-into-view-after-dispatch-miss` point to `scrollintoview <target>` before retry. When the workflow depends on a mutation, use `details.pageChangeSummary`, a wait, URL/text extraction, or a fresh `snapshot -i` before trusting the state; if nothing changed, retry with a current visible ref or stable selector and report the workflow issue. For static local fixtures or debugging where the user explicitly accepts scripted activation, `eval --stdin` can call `document.querySelector(...).click()` to exercise inline handlers and app code; treat that as an untrusted programmatic event, not as evidence that CDP/user-like clicking works. Respect explicit user stop boundaries yourself: if the user says to stop before a final order, post, purchase, or submit action, gather evidence from that page and do not click the final action or use scripted activation to bypass the stop. The wrapper does not infer broad business intent from prompt text; `details.promptGuard` is reserved for concrete artifact-before-close checks. `press`, `key`, `keydown`, and `keyup` accept exactly one key token; focus or click the target first, then run `press Enter` or another single-key command.

Successful `snapshot -i` results can also surface `Possible overlay blockers` when their own refs already show dialog/alertdialog context plus close/dismiss controls, so agents can detect likely obstruction before clicking. When a **top-level** `@e…`/`ref=` click succeeds (not a `click` hidden inside a `batch`/`job` tool call—the unified command must be `click`), the upstream payload includes `data.clicked`, no `details.clickDispatch` diagnostic fired for the same result, and the wrapper sees `details.navigationSummary.url` unchanged after the same normalization it uses for ref guards (**`#fragment` ignored**), it may run one extra `snapshot -i` and surface `Possible overlay blockers` plus `details.overlayBlockers` (`candidates`, `summary`, and a `snapshot` map that can refresh `refSnapshot`) when that snapshot shows strong modal context (`dialog` / `alertdialog`) **and** up to three close/dismiss-like controls; page-wide words such as privacy, sign in, or banner alone do not trigger it. The URL check compares the session’s prior pinned tab target to `details.navigationSummary.url`. CSS selector clicks do not run this overlay probe. The diagnostic is skipped if the wrapper already applied tab-focus correction or about-blank recovery on that result. Appended `inspect-overlay-state` / `try-overlay-blocker-candidate-*` entries in `details.nextActions` preserve namespace/session context (`--namespace <namespace> --session <name>` when namespaced, otherwise `--session <name>` when the session is named), same as other session-scoped follow-ups. Treat `inspect-overlay-state` as the safe first follow-up; only use a `try-overlay-blocker-candidate-*` next action when the candidate is clearly the control you intend to close. A click that upstream rejects because another element covers the target's click point (`is covered by` … `at its click point`) remains `failureCategory: "upstream-error"`, but receives the same session-aware `inspect-overlay-state` snapshot action. This includes direct `click`, `semanticAction` click, raw `find` clicks (including `nth` and omitted default-click actions), and failed `batch`/`job` rows. That failed-click path does not retry the original click or synthesize a dismiss candidate before a fresh snapshot provides evidence; it is separate from silent input-dispatch failures.

### Extract page data

```json
{ "args": ["read", "https://example.com/docs", "--filter", "authentication"] }
{ "args": ["read"] }
{ "args": ["get", "title"] }
{ "args": ["get", "url"] }
{ "args": ["get", "text", "main"] }
{ "args": ["eval", "--stdin"], "stdin": "document.title" }
```

Use `read [url]` for documentation and other unstructured text. `read <url> --raw` preserves the response body, `read <url> --require-md` requires `text/markdown`, `read <url> --llms <index|full>` reads the nearest ancestor llms index/full file, `read <url> --outline` emits headings, `read <url> --filter <text>` narrows matching sections/headings/links, and `read <url> --timeout <ms>` changes the request timeout. Explicit URL reads prefer markdown, try a `.md` path and nearby `llms.txt` links, then fall back to readable HTML without requiring a Chrome page. The wrapper does not allocate or replace a managed browser for an explicit URL read or all-read batch. It skips page verification, tab/ref changes and timeout page probes; malformed read arguments go to native validation without falling back to a DOM preflight. Caller config and flags remain native-owned. `Read execution` reports source, CLI start and native launch evidence without treating the HTTP read as proof of shared-browser liveness. Use `session info` for that. Native no-browser-effects behavior requires the companion upstream fix; older supported binaries do not guarantee it merely because the wrapper skips helpers. Omit the URL to read rendered active-tab DOM, including current browser auth and client-side state; `--llms` / `--require-md` without a URL instead fetch from the active tab URL. The wrapper renders `data.content` first, retains source/content-type/status/final-URL metadata in `details.data`, keeps fetched URLs from replacing the active browser tab target, and extends its subprocess watchdog for explicit long read timeouts.

When you already know several visible refs or selectors, extract them in one `batch` call instead of many serial getter calls. When a prior snapshot and session are available and the same-page freshness checks apply, ref-consuming calls add one extra `snapshot -i` preflight per top-level call or batch. Batching shares that probe across rows; it does not remove it:

```json
{ "args": ["batch"], "stdin": "[[\"get\",\"text\",\"@e64\"],[\"get\",\"text\",\"@e65\"],[\"get\",\"text\",\"@e66\"]]" }
```

Prefer `get` and scoped `eval --stdin` for read-only extraction. Getter names are grouped under `get`: use `get title`, `get url`, or `get text <selector>`, not shortcut commands such as `title` or `url`. When upstream reports an unknown command, unknown subcommand, or unrecognized command for a single-token shortcut (`attr`, `count`, `html`, `text`, `title`, `url`, or `value`), the wrapper adds a visible grouped-`get` hint; only `title` and `url` also get exact read-only `details.nextActions` (`use-get-title` / `use-get-url`, with `--session` preserved when the failed call named a session). If another `Agent-browser hint:` (selector dialect or stale-ref recovery) was already appended to the same error text, the getter hint is omitted.

Return the intended JavaScript value from `eval --stdin` instead of relying on `console.log`. In the native pi tool, the JavaScript belongs in the top-level `stdin` field; do **not** write it as a third `args` item such as `{ "args": ["eval", "--stdin", "document.title"] }`. The wrapper tolerates that common misplaced form by moving the trailing token to stdin before spawn, but the explicit `stdin` field is the documented form and avoids ambiguity for multiline snippets. For object-shaped extraction, pass a plain expression such as `({ title: document.title, url: location.href })`; if the result should be kept outside the transcript as a durable file, add top-level `outputPath` (for example `{ "args": ["eval", "--stdin"], "stdin": "({ title: document.title })", "outputPath": "logs/page-title.json" }`). If you send a function-shaped snippet, invoke it explicitly, for example `(() => ({ title: document.title }))()`. When upstream serializes a function result to `{}`, the wrapper can append `Eval stdin hint` and `details.evalStdinHint`. Snippets run in the page's per-tab global scope, so top-level `const`/`let`/`function` declarations persist across calls and later snippets can fail with `SyntaxError: Identifier ... has already been declared`; wrap multi-statement extraction in an IIFE instead of redeclaring names. After a failed `eval`, `back`/`forward`/`reload`, `connect`, `state load`, or `tab` selection, the wrapper probes the live page URL itself and keeps an observed page verified, so follow-up reads do not need a manual `get url` unless the result says the page became unverified; because the failed command may still have changed the document, prior page-scoped refs are invalidated and need a fresh `snapshot -i` before reuse.

On tabbed or hidden-DOM pages, `get text <selector>` reads the upstream-selected match, which may be hidden even when a later match is visible. For non-`@ref`, non-simple-id CSS selectors with multiple matches, including successful `batch` steps, the wrapper may add `Selector text visibility warning`, `details.selectorTextVisibility` (and `details.selectorTextVisibilityAll` for multiple batched warnings), and `inspect-visible-text-candidates` next actions. The warning names the matching `details.nextActions` id so agents know to use a fresher `snapshot -i`, a visible `@ref`, or a more specific selector instead of trusting hidden tab content. If the probe still leaves multiple visible candidates, do not keep reading the broad selector; switch to a current visible `@ref`, add a narrower selector such as a known panel/container id, or use a targeted `eval --stdin` expression that filters for visible elements and returns the intended index/text.

### Run a multi-step flow in one browser invocation

```json
{ "args": ["batch"], "stdin": "[[\"open\",\"https://example.com\"],[\"snapshot\",\"-i\"]]" }
```

Use exact `batch --bail` when later steps should stop after the first failed command; omit it to continue after errors. `--bail=true` / `--bail=false` are unsupported: upstream treats them as raw command strings and ignores stdin. The wrapper returns shape guidance without running that ignored stdin. Tab recovery does not change caller flags, literal operands, or batch control flow; a failed wrapper tab selection stops before user commands. Both pinned and unpinned mixed failures retain per-step results and failure counts.

For short constrained flows, use top-level `job` instead of hand-writing `batch` stdin. Supported job steps are `open`, `click`, `fill`, `type`, `select`, `wait`, `assertText`, `assertUrl`, `waitForDownload`, `snapshot`, and `screenshot`. `open` can include `loadState: "domcontentloaded" | "load" | "networkidle"` to insert a `wait --load …` row immediately after navigation before the next click/read step. `click` and `fill` accept either a stable `selector` or the same semantic locator fields as top-level `semanticAction` (`locator`, plus `role`/`name` or `value` as appropriate) and compile locator steps to upstream `find` argv. `type` focuses an optional selector, sends text through upstream keyboard typing, can insert `wait` rows via `delayMs` for human-paced input, and can append a final `press` key such as `Enter`; delayed typing is capped at 200 characters per step, and generated per-character rows are compacted in model-visible batch text while remaining available in `details.batchSteps`. `select` requires `selector` plus `value` or `values`, and compiles to upstream `select <selector> <value...>`. By default the wrapper compiles steps to upstream `batch --bail` so a failed setup/fill/assertion step stops later mutating clicks; set `failFast: false` only when you explicitly need continue-after-error diagnostics and those later steps remain safe if an earlier navigation fails; otherwise keep fail-fast or split navigation from content. The wrapper records `details.compiledJob.steps[]` plus `details.compiledJob.failFast`. There is still no separate first-class catalog of reusable named browser recipes above `job`, the `qa` preset, and raw `batch`; see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md#no-reusable-recipe-layer-yet) for the closed `RQ-0068` decision and revisit bar.

`assertText` takes only `text`, not selector or locator fields. Clicks can stale subsequent `@refs`; split the job and take a fresh snapshot before using them.

**Job navigation is explicit.** A `click` step (or other navigation-prone interaction) does not prove the next page loaded. The wrapper does not auto-insert `assertUrl` or `assertText` after clicks inside `job`; add those steps yourself with the exact URL, a `*` / `**` glob-style URL pattern, or on-page text you expect, especially after forms, checkout, tabs, or submit buttons, before screenshots or later steps. Exact and glob-style `assertUrl` values compile to `wait --url` unchanged, including query strings and literal `?`; upstream `agent-browser 0.31.1` matches `*` / `**` patterns against the full active URL. Do not put a whole dynamic checkout into one long job: split around login, sorting/cart mutations, checkout navigation, and final evidence capture so refs and app state can be rechecked between phases.

```json
{
  "job": {
    "steps": [
      { "action": "open", "url": "https://example.com" },
      { "action": "assertText", "text": "Example Domain" },
      { "action": "screenshot", "path": ".dogfood/example.png" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Human-paced typing flow:

```json
{
  "job": {
    "steps": [
      { "action": "open", "url": "https://example.test/form" },
      { "action": "type", "selector": "#prompt", "text": "hello", "delayMs": 20, "press": "Enter" },
      { "action": "assertText", "text": "Submitted" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Navigation-prone flow (open → fill → click → assert destination → screenshot):

```json
{
  "job": {
    "steps": [
      { "action": "open", "url": "https://shop.example/checkout" },
      { "action": "fill", "selector": "#email", "text": "user@example.com" },
      { "action": "click", "selector": "#continue" },
      { "action": "assertUrl", "url": "**/shipping" },
      { "action": "assertText", "text": "Shipping address" },
      { "action": "screenshot", "path": ".dogfood/shipping.png" }
    ]
  }
}
```

On app pages that expose a native dropdown, add a `select` step such as `{ "action": "select", "selector": "#flavor", "value": "chocolate" }` before the assertion that depends on it. Insert `{ "action": "snapshot" }` between mutation-prone steps when a later job row needs fresh `@refs`. On pages where stable CSS is not known, use semantic job steps such as `{ "action": "fill", "locator": "role", "role": "searchbox", "name": "Search", "text": "agent browser" }` and `{ "action": "click", "locator": "role", "role": "button", "name": "Search" }` instead of guessing selectors.

Use raw `args: ["batch"]` with `stdin` when you need arbitrary upstream commands, flags, or batch failure policies outside the constrained schema. Do not pass `stdin` with `job`, `qa`, `sourceLookup`, `networkSourceLookup`, or `electron`; those modes generate or manage their own input.

For quick smoke/QA checks, use top-level `qa`. It clears enabled network/console buffers and snapshots any page-error residue after the unreliable upstream clear, then opens the target URL and gives immediate post-load console/page-error callbacks a bounded 150 ms settle, waits for page readiness, checks expected text/selector, then inspects fresh network requests, console messages, and page errors only if preceding assertions pass, and can capture an evidence screenshot. Successful reset rows are labeled as reset-scoped diagnostic output. If final page-error rows match a nonempty post-clear baseline, QA is non-pass with “page-error check could not be verified”: identical new errors can replace old rows in the native FIFO buffer without changing the result. Those matches are not proof of new application errors. Definitely new rows, including errors after an empty baseline, count separately as page errors; a clean final buffer can pass. Explicit `checkErrors: false` omits this check for a more limited smoke test. The preset compiles to `batch --bail` so a missing text/selector assertion fails crisply instead of letting slower diagnostics burn the wrapper watchdog. Expected text compiles to bounded visible-text `wait --fn … --timeout 5000` predicates after load so dense pages can pass on visible headings/copy without dumping `body` text; missing text reports a crisp QA failure. The readiness wait defaults to `loadState: "domcontentloaded"`; set `loadState` to `"load"` or `"networkidle"` only when that stricter state is useful and the site is not expected to keep background requests alive. QA network diagnostics classify failed requests by likely impact and list failed rows first in the network preview: actionable document/script/API-style failures fail the preset, while common low-impact browser icon misses such as `favicon.ico` are surfaced as warnings (`qaPreset.warnings`) so they do not fail an otherwise healthy page. Successful QA with no failed checks returns compact model-visible prose (page URL/title when known, checks run, optional screenshot verification) while keeping the full step matrix in `details.qaPreset` and `details.batchSteps`. Failed QA presets report `details.resultCategory: "failure"`, `failureCategory: "qa-failure"`, show compact failure reasons with the full matrix in `details.batchSteps`, and real Pi sessions treat the diagnostic as a failed tool result. Prose output also gets a model-visible result-category line including `Pi tool isError: true`; caller-requested `--json` output keeps the JSON string parseable and relies on the patched `isError` plus `details` fields.

The same classification drives plain `network requests` presentation: when any row counts as failed (HTTP status ≥ 400, `failed: true`, or a string `error`), model-facing text starts with a line like `Network failure summary: 0 actionable, 1 benign low-impact (1 total).`, and each preview line can end with an impact tag such as `[benign: low-impact browser icon asset]` or `[actionable: document, script, API, or non-benign request failure]`. When safe request IDs are present, `details.nextActions` adds bounded read-only follow-ups such as `network request <id>`, `networkSourceLookup` for actionable failed rows, `network requests --filter <path>`, `network requests --clear` before a repro, and `network har start`; prefer those payloads over rebuilding request-id commands from prose. For aggregate buffers, the wrapper accepts `network requests --current-page` / `--current-origin` to render only rows matching the active page origin, or `--current-url` for exact active document URL matching; it strips those wrapper-only flags before upstream spawn and reports counts in `details.networkRequestsPageFilter`. If the wrapper has seen a prior `network route` in the same session, matching failed, pending, or CORS-looking fetch/XHR rows add `details.networkRouteDiagnostics` plus executable route-mock follow-ups (`inspect-routed-network-request` and `start-network-har-capture-for-route-mock`) so agents do not mistake an unfulfilled mock for a fulfilled mock; same-origin/CORS fixture retry guidance stays in visible prose. `network requests` also hides `data:image` screenshot/artifact noise from the compact preview by default while preserving raw rows in `details.data.requests`. Rules live in `classifyNetworkRequestFailure` / `summarizeNetworkFailures` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/results/network.ts`; QA aggregation is `analyzeQaPresetResults` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/input-modes/job.ts`.

```json
{ "qa": { "url": "https://example.com", "expectedText": "Example Domain", "screenshotPath": ".dogfood/qa-example.png" } }
```

Optional `loadState`, `checkNetwork`, `checkConsole`, and `checkErrors` default to `"domcontentloaded"`, `true`, `true`, and `true` for URL-opening QA; set a check to `false` to skip that diagnostic. For `qa.attached`, the diagnostic checks default to `false` because upstream buffers may predate the current check; opt in with `checkNetwork`, `checkConsole`, or `checkErrors` when preserved-buffer failures are desired. Omit `expectedText` and `expectedSelector` when you only need load plus diagnostics.

For attached Electron or manually connected CDP sessions, use `qa.attached` after the session exists. It does not open a URL and rejects `sessionMode: "fresh"` because it checks the current managed session. Before running diagnostics, the wrapper requires a readable non-empty page URL on the attached session; missing URLs and read failures fail fast with recovery `nextActions` such as `tab list` and `snapshot -i` instead of running the full QA batch. `file:`, custom-scheme, and other attached targets are accepted. Unlike URL-opening QA, `qa.attached` preserves existing upstream network/console/page-error buffers; by default it does not inspect those buffers so stale rows do not false-fail a current-page smoke check. Set `checkNetwork`, `checkConsole`, or `checkErrors` to `true` to opt into preserved-buffer diagnostics; model-visible text and `details.compiledQaPreset.checks.diagnosticsResetAtStart` call out that preserved diagnostics may include earlier events.

```json
{ "qa": { "attached": true, "expectedText": "Explorer", "screenshotPath": ".dogfood/electron.png" } }
```

Use custom `job` or raw `batch` when you need a different check sequence.

### Electron desktop apps

Full public guide: [`ELECTRON.md`](ELECTRON.md). Use it as the entry point when Electron support is the task; this section keeps the inline workflow snippets for agents reading the broader command surface.

Use top-level `electron` when the wrapper should discover, launch, attach to, probe, and clean up a desktop Electron app. The wrapper owns only launches it created. It uses an isolated temporary `userDataDir`, `--remote-debugging-port=0`, and safe launch defaults; it does **not** reuse the app's normal signed-in profile or attach to an already-running authenticated app. For already-authenticated desktop app content, do not stop at the isolated-launch warning: when host tools are available and the app is not already running, launch the normal app with a debug port (macOS example: `open -a Slack --args --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-allow-origins='*'`), verify the port, then attach with `{ "args": ["connect", "9222"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }`; if the app is already running without a debug port, ask before relaunching it. Remote debugging still exposes app content, so use caller-owned `allow` / `deny` lists for sensitive app policies when needed. `electron.list` may annotate common private-data apps as `[likely sensitive: …]`; this is advisory metadata only and does not block `launch` or replace caller policy.

Install scans for `electron.list` (and resolving `appName` / `bundleId` targets) are implemented for **macOS and Linux** hosts only. On **Windows**, `list` returns `platform: "unsupported"` with no apps, so prefer `executablePath` (or a host `appPath` that points at the real Electron `.exe`) when launching there—the wrapper still runs Electron evidence checks on that path before spawn.

Typical lifecycle:

```json
{ "electron": { "action": "list", "query": "code" } }
{ "electron": { "action": "launch", "appName": "Visual Studio Code", "handoff": "snapshot" } }
{ "args": ["snapshot", "-i"] }
{ "electron": { "action": "probe", "timeoutMs": 5000 } }
{ "electron": { "action": "cleanup", "launchId": "electron-…" } }
```

`electron.status` and `electron.cleanup` take either `launchId`, **`all: true`** (literal boolean) to walk every active wrapper-tracked launch (including dead, failed, or partial records, but excluding cleaned records), or neither when exactly one active launch exists—never both `launchId` and `all`. They can target the current branch-visible launch plus still-owned off-branch launch records by `launchId`; default no-arg calls are intentionally ambiguous when more than one active launch is owned. `/reload` preserves the current branch-visible active Electron launch and its isolated temp `userDataDir` for continuity, and cleans off-branch owned Electron launches. First reuse after reload/resume checks the live app's saved debug endpoint and the exact named upstream connection with `get cdp-url`, without reconnecting or resetting page refs; if cleanup is partial and skips or fails profile removal, the generic temp sweep preserves that `userDataDir` across reload, quit, later temp cleanup, process exit, and stale temp-root pruning after restart. `electron.list` has no configurable timeout and rejects both top-level and nested `timeoutMs`. For `electron.launch`, nested `timeoutMs` sets host CDP readiness polling to a **15s** default and **120s** cap after target discovery; upstream attach and handoff use separate subprocess budgets. Optional `timeoutMs` on **`status`** applies to each managed-session `get url` / `get title` read and any `get cdp-url` read needed to verify a restored connection (localhost CDP probes stay on a short fixed fetch budget). On **`cleanup`**, it is applied separately to upstream `close` and the initial host process-exit wait, not to the entire teardown; debug-port checks have fixed fetch budgets and profile removal has no configurable deadline; when omitted it follows the implicit session close default (**5s** unless `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_IMPLICIT_SESSION_CLOSE_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides). A successful managed-session close step retires that wrapper-managed session even when host process/profile cleanup remains partial. On **`probe`**, it bounds each underlying upstream read subprocess—omit it to use the normal tool subprocess default, or raise it on slow desktops.

Explicit-ID `electron.status` labels a cleaned record as historical while measuring PID/port liveness independently. `details.electron.statuses[].userDataDirState` freshly reports the tracked profile path as `present`, `absent` (only ENOENT), or `unknown` (other native `lstat` errors); dangling symlinks are present. This is not an audit of all app residue and does not change stored launch records or cleanup ownership.

`launch.handoff` defaults to `"snapshot"`, which attaches through upstream `connect`, lists targets, and captures a current `snapshot -i` in one call. Snapshot handoff retries briefly when the first Electron snapshot has no refs; if it still reports no refs, run `snapshot -i` once more before assuming the app is blank. Use `handoff: "tabs"` as the safer diagnostic starting point when you only need target discovery and do not want to snapshot app content yet, or `handoff: "connect"` when you want to attach first and run your own follow-up commands. `targetType` defaults to `"page"`; use `"webview"` or `"any"` for apps that expose useful webviews. When a matching CDP target exposes a WebSocket URL, launch connects to that target; otherwise it falls back to the browser port.

After launch, prefer the exact `details.nextActions` payloads when present: `status-electron-launch` checks liveness, `probe-electron-launch` runs compact diagnostics for a tracked launch, `snapshot-electron-session` refreshes current refs, `list-electron-tabs` inspects targets, and `cleanup-electron-launch` removes the wrapper-owned process/profile when the run is done. If startup fails, inspect the redacted stdout/stderr tails in visible error text and `details.electron.failure.diagnostics`, plus PID, wrapper profile, `DevToolsActivePort`, and timing evidence before retrying. Tails read at most 4096 source bytes per stream; private log files follow profile cleanup/preservation and are not lifetime-size-capped. If status/probe detects a session or target mismatch, follow `reattach-electron-launch` or a fresh snapshot action before using old refs. If a click/fill/type looks successful but the Electron PID or debug port dies, the wrapper now fails the result with `details.electronPostCommandHealth` and same-launch status/probe/cleanup next actions instead of leaving the agent on `about:blank`. If cleanup is partial (`failureCategory: "cleanup-failed"`), inspect `details.electron.cleanup.results` and use `retry-electron-cleanup` only for the same `launchId`.

Manual path for externally launched apps: if you started the Electron app yourself with a debug port or DevTools URL, skip the wrapper lifecycle and attach directly with upstream `connect`. In this path you own app shutdown and profile cleanup; do not use `electron.cleanup`. close commands (`close`, `quit`, or `exit`) only close the browser/CDP session and do not quit the manually launched app or remove explicit artifacts.

```json
{ "args": ["connect", "9222"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }
{ "args": ["tab", "list"] }
{ "args": ["tab", "t2"] }
{ "args": ["snapshot", "-i"] }
```

A successful raw `connect` means the debug endpoint accepted the session, not that the app has an active ready page. Prefer `details.nextActions` when present: `verify-connected-session-url` performs the only page read allowed while the attached target is unverified, and `list-connected-session-tabs` runs session-scoped tab inspection. A verified HTTP(S)/app target clears the guard; otherwise navigate explicitly to a safe URL. After the read-only tab list, select or confirm the stable `t<N>` target, verify it with `get url`, and run `snapshot -i` explicitly before trusting refs. If a `snapshot -i` says `No active page`, the wrapper clears any prior refs for that session; follow `list-tabs-after-no-active-page`, select the stable `t<N>` surface, then use a condition wait or retry `snapshot -i` before trusting refs.

For current-session smoke checks after either path, use `qa.attached`; for compact state instead of separate title/url/focus/tab/snapshot calls, use `electron.probe`. `electron.probe.timeoutMs` bounds each underlying read subprocess; `electron.probe.launchId` ties the probe to a wrapper launch and can surface session or target mismatch guidance before you trust page refs. Electron status target reads and probe reads use the same daemon-policy lock and owned restore decision as ordinary managed commands. A probe reads and validates the live URL before title, focus, tab, or snapshot helpers. Electron `launch` snapshot/tabs handoff likewise validates the URL before tab/snapshot reads; handoff failure or cancellation closes the new managed session and host process/profile. Current-managed probe results persist their top-level namespace, tab target, and ref snapshot so Pi reload/branch replay restores the same page identity. For VS Code-style quick inputs, treat a successful `fill` as tentative: the wrapper may append `details.fillVerification` if `get value` still reads empty or different, and Electron `@e…` mutations can append `refresh-electron-refs-after-rerender` because same-URL UI rerenders commonly churn refs.

For local app debugging, top-level `sourceLookup` can gather candidate component/file locations for a visible element from selector DOM hints, React DevTools inspection, and a bounded workspace component-name search rooted at the Pi session working directory (`maxWorkspaceFiles` defaults to 2000 and cannot exceed 5000; the scan records at most ten `workspace-search` candidates). With a `selector`, the wrapper runs `is visible` and, unless `includeDomHints` is `false`, `get html` so DOM data attributes and embedded source-like paths can become `dom-attribute` candidates. It reports evidence and confidence in `details.sourceLookup` instead of claiming a guaranteed source file. React hints require a session opened with `--enable react-devtools`. The `details.sourceLookup.status` field reads `unsupported` only when no candidates were collected **and** a `react` batch step failed (inspect errors, missing renderer, and similar); it reads `no-candidates` when the batch succeeded but nothing matched. If selector or workspace hints still yield candidates, `status` remains `candidates-found` even when React inspection failed. Unlike `qa`, the wrapper does not downgrade a **fully successful** upstream batch to `isError` solely because those statuses appear—though failed batch steps still produce normal tool errors. For wrapper-tracked packaged Electron sessions with no candidates, `details.sourceLookup.workspaceRoot` and optional `details.sourceLookup.electronContext` explain that the scan only covered the Pi tool cwd; installed app resources or `app.asar` bundles are outside that scan and are not unpacked. Those results may add `snapshot-electron-session`, `probe-electron-launch`, and `list-electron-tabs` next actions so you can inspect the live packaged app before deciding whether to change the workspace or app bundle.

```json
{ "sourceLookup": { "selector": "#save", "reactFiberId": "2", "componentName": "SaveButton" } }
```

Top-level `networkSourceLookup` does the same for failed browser requests. When `requestId` is set it adds `network request <requestId>`; when `filter` or `url` is set it also adds `network requests --filter …`, using `url` as the filter pattern when `filter` is omitted. Add `namespace` / `session` when the generated batch should target an explicit upstream namespace/session; `namespace: ""` explicitly selects the default namespace and overrides an ambient namespace. With `requestId` only, the compiled batch is just that request step; failed-request detection still walks the returned batch JSON and treats HTTP status ≥ 400, `failed: true`, or an `error` field as failure. When `filter` or `url` is present, the same heuristics apply but requests are correlated only if their URL matches that substring (either direction). Workspace URL literal search under the Pi session cwd reuses the `sourceLookup` scan rules (`maxWorkspaceFiles` defaults to 2000, hard cap 5000, at most ten `workspace-search` rows, up to eight URL/path needles from the query plus failed request URLs). It reports `details.networkSourceLookup.status` as `failed-requests-found`, `no-failed-requests`, or `no-candidates` and never assigns definitive blame. Request-detail URLs are diagnostic evidence, not active-tab evidence: standalone `network request …` and generated `networkSourceLookup` batches preserve the previous app page target and latest same-page `refSnapshot`.

```json
{ "networkSourceLookup": { "requestId": "req-1", "url": "/api/fail" } }
```

### Wait for page readiness or downloads

```json
{ "args": ["wait", "--load", "networkidle"] }
{ "args": ["wait", "--url", "https://app.example/dashboard"] }
{ "args": ["wait", "--download", "/tmp/report.pdf"] }
```

Do not omit the load state value; use `wait --load <state>` with `load`, `domcontentloaded`, or `networkidle`.

For desktop-host readiness, prefer condition waits over fixed sleeps. Use this ladder: `wait --text` / `wait --url` / `wait --fn` / `wait --load <state>` / `wait --download` when a real condition exists; after raw `connect`, run `tab list` → `tab t<N>` → condition wait or `snapshot -i`; after wrapper-owned `electron.launch`, use `electron.probe` / `electron.status` for launch health or target mismatch; use `qa.attached` when expected text or selector plus diagnostics can express the check. Upstream `agent-browser 0.31.1` supports `wait --url` glob forms such as `**/dashboard` against the full active URL. Fixed waits are a last resort: use explicit `--timeout` or top-level `timeoutMs` for legitimately slow waits, and treat a successful fixed-wait payload such as `"waited":"timeout"` as elapsed time only, not proof that the desktop host finished. Verify with an observed condition, fresh snapshot, or screenshot before continuing.

Use `wait --download [path]` after an earlier action has already started a browser download, such as a dashboard export button that responds asynchronously. Use the control's current snapshot ref (for example `@e5`):

```json
{ "args": ["click", "@e5"] }
{ "args": ["wait", "--download", "/tmp/report.csv"] }
```

For one-call flows, put the click and wait in `batch`; the wait step keeps the saved-file metadata in `details.batchSteps[n].savedFilePath` and `details.batchSteps[n].savedFile`:

```json
{ "args": ["batch"], "stdin": "[[\"click\",\"@e5\"],[\"wait\",\"--download\",\"/tmp/report.csv\"]]" }
```

A successful wait-based download renders a readable summary such as `Download completed: /tmp/report.csv` and exposes top-level `details.savedFilePath` plus `details.savedFile` for non-batch calls. With current upstream `agent-browser`, `wait --download <path>` may report the requested path before this environment can verify that the file was persisted there. Treat `details.savedFilePath` as upstream-reported metadata unless `details.artifacts[].exists` is true. Upstream tracking: [vercel-labs/agent-browser#1300](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser/issues/1300).

### Download, screenshot, and PDF files

```json
{ "args": ["download", "@e5", "/tmp/report.pdf"] }
{ "args": ["screenshot", "/tmp/page.png"] }
{ "args": ["screenshot", "--full", "/tmp/full-page.png"] }
{ "args": ["screenshot", "--annotate", "/tmp/annotated.png"] }
{ "args": ["pdf", "/tmp/page.pdf"] }
```

The upstream screenshot aliases are `screenshot --full` for full-page capture and `screenshot --annotate` for labeled screenshots. Annotated screenshots can be noisy on dense pages because labels overlap real content; when labels obscure evidence, capture a scoped element screenshot, take a non-annotated screenshot, or use `snapshot -i` high-value refs as the machine-readable map. When a user gives exact artifact paths for screenshots, recordings, downloads, PDFs, traces, or HAR files, use those paths or explicitly report why the artifact was unavailable; do not silently substitute another path in the final report. When the latest prompt names exact required screenshot paths, `close` / `quit` / `exit` can be blocked with `details.promptGuard.reason: "requested-artifacts-missing-before-close"` until those paths appear as verified explicit artifacts.

Prefer `download <selector> <path>` when the target element itself is the downloadable link/control. For simple loopback HTML anchors with `href` and a non-ref selector, the wrapper first reads the resolved anchor URL and saves the in-page credentialed response directly to the requested host path, avoiding upstream random-name download spills in local fixture tests; non-loopback/profile downloads still use upstream fallback. Use `click` plus `wait --download [path]` when a previous action starts the download indirectly.

For evidence-only screenshots, QA captures, or audit artifacts, save to an explicit path and branch on `details.artifactVerification` plus `details.artifacts` before reporting PASS/FAIL. Inline image attachments are optional convenience when size limits allow; do not require vision review unless the user asked for visual inspection.

Wrapper result rendering is metadata-first for saved files. Image MIME types come from a bounded header read for PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP, never from a filename suffix; missing, unreadable, unknown or truncated headers omit `mediaType`. This identifies a format, not full image validity. Inline screenshots use the same byte check and existing size limit, so a PNG saved as `.webm` still attaches as `image/png`; other artifact kinds are not auto-inlined. An artifact-producing command fails as `artifact-missing` with artifact `status: "stale"` when the reported path's `mtimeMs` falls outside the command's bounded start/end window (with two seconds of filesystem precision tolerance), including a previous recording that `record restart` claims to finalize; clearly old or future-dated evidence is never accepted as a fresh capture. A batch, whether supplied through stdin arrays or argument command strings, must use distinct explicit artifact destinations; preflight canonicalizes existing path ancestry, compares existing file identities to catch hardlinks, and applies full Unicode plus platform case folding on macOS/Windows so aliases cannot satisfy another step's verification. The same preflight prevents `outputPath` from aliasing a same-call browser artifact, follows upstream's forward option consumption and final effective `-o` / `--output` for `diff screenshot`, and treats the optional path on `network har stop` as an artifact destination; upstream ignores positional paths on `network har start`. Outer CLI artifact parsing removes upstream global flags, so direct forms such as `record --json start <path>` and `pdf --quiet <path>` retain their native destinations. Native batch rows do not run that cleanup: `pdf --quick ignored.pdf` writes to the literal path `--quick`, and `download #link --quiet ignored.bin` writes to `--quiet`. Preflight, directory preparation, presentation, and timeout evidence use those same operands, not the ignored trailing tokens. Screenshot destination parsing mirrors upstream's exact flag matching and `[selector] [path]` positional order: `--` is positional, `true` / `false` after screenshot-only `--full` / `-f` remain positional, extra positionals are ignored after the path slot, selector-prefixed (`.`, `#`, `@`) or uppercase-extension single arguments remain selectors, and lowercase image extensions or slash-bearing arguments are paths. The wrapper deliberately keeps its existing slash-bearing hidden-workspace path normalization (for example `.dogfood/run/foo.png`) before launch. `wait --download` is observational and may verify a download that completed just before the wait began, so it is exempt from the command-window mtime gate; an explicit wait destination, in long `--download <path>` or short `-d <path>` form (including `wait --download --timeout 30000 capture.csv`), still participates in active-recording reservation preflight; the path is the next retained operand after the first timeout pair is removed; unsupported `--download=<path>` fails with split-argument guidance:
- screenshots return a saved-path summary, visible artifact metadata, structured `details.artifacts` metadata, and an inline image attachment when safe; the visible block includes artifact type, requested path, absolute path, existence, size, cwd, session, and repair/copy status when applicable
- downloads, PDFs, `wait --download` files, `state save` state files, diff screenshot output images, traces, CPU profiles, completed video recordings from `record stop`, and path-bearing HAR captures return concise saved-path summaries plus structured `details.artifacts` metadata without inlining large files
- `record start <path>` and `record restart <path>` report `successCategory: "artifact-pending"` and that output will be written on `record stop`; dispatched `record start` and URL-bearing `record restart` attempts append one `Page state:` warning on success or failure, describing conservative ref invalidation rather than an observed page change; explicit `--json` puts that warning in `warnings`. Only reached batch rows qualify, not preflight failures, missing binaries, help calls or unconfirmed planned rows — the wrapper invalidates the session’s prior ref snapshot (direct calls and batch steps alike, and even when the start fails with `Recording already active`, to protect older supported natives that can swap the page before that check), so old `@e…` refs fail as `stale-ref` until a fresh `snapshot -i` succeeds; `record restart <path> <url>` navigates the current page and invalidates refs the same way, while a restart without a URL, including FPS-only options, keeps the current page and refs; `details.artifacts` / `details.artifactVerification` mark that future file as `pending` with `recordingState: "openRecording"` and `willExistOnStop: true`, and `details.nextActions` includes exact `stop-pending-recording` args. When `record restart` returns a native `previousRecording`, that receipt's outcome and capture window control the previous artifact's verification; a legacy file without a terminal native receipt remains unverified, not saved; a missing or stale prior file fails as `artifact-missing` while the new recording remains visible as pending and the prior manifest row is retired. Within one Pi extension process, an unbounded transcript-backed index reserves active recording destinations independently of the bounded artifact manifest. Artifact lifecycle calls and result `outputPath` writes serialize around that global check; reservations use canonical namespace/session identity, survive manifest eviction and branch replay, and retire after direct, ordered nested-batch, fresh-replacement, script, Electron, or shutdown close; the newest pending row per identity is authoritative. Legacy batch replay retires a pending manifest only when the ordered close lifecycle leaves recording closed; a later successful browser reactivation plus `record start` keeps the new pending reservation. Lexical, hardlink, existing/dangling symlink, full Unicode-fold, and macOS/Windows case aliases are rejected, so `record restart` must use a distinct new path. Do not place `record start` or `record restart` after `close` / `quit` / `exit` in one batch: wrapper preflight rejects it because upstream can report success without starting a recording; split the close and recording into separate calls. A `No recording in progress` stop failure checks the matching native receipt once and preserves checked file metadata instead of assuming the path is missing; a later successful batch recording row opens its new pending path normally. Recovery offers an exact status query, and a stop only when the matching take is still current and pending. The target remains unverified until recording stops. Native 0.37 checks `ffmpeg` before starting; older supported natives may defer failure. If a successful start/restart reports pending output without `ffmpeg`, the wrapper appends `Recording dependency warning: ffmpeg not found on PATH` and `details.recordingDependencyWarning`; stop, check the result, then install the dependency before starting a new recording.
- `batch` keeps each step's artifacts in `details.batchSteps[].artifacts`; top-level `details.artifacts` and `details.artifactManifest` coalesce an earlier pending recording into the later saved, missing, or stale terminal result for the same namespace/session identity; a successful later close retires an unfinalized recording as `close-abandoned`, uses `missing` only after a filesystem check proves absence (otherwise unverified), removes its stop action, and resets earlier ref/page/network-route batch state; a later successful `record stop` replaces that intermediate abandoned row with its verified saved artifact, and later rows—including failed rows—whose lifecycle reports a browser launch may rebuild state without triggering stale pre-close `about:blank` recovery; failed-step `batchSteps[]` retains only the bounded `lifecycle.effectiveLaunch.browserLaunched` boolean for replay, explicitly non-launching diagnostics leave the close terminal, missing lifecycle evidence remains conservatively active even on the first managed call, every successful close clears wrapper trace/profiler ownership before ordered later successful rows can rebuild it, namespace-scoped `close --all` clears all matching managed/attached/page/ref/route/trace/recording ownership, and any later same-session failure before recording stops keeps exact `stop-pending-recording` args alongside its normal recovery

`diff screenshot` follows the file-artifact path above for the **diff** image: model-visible text and `details.artifacts` focus on that output, while baseline paths stay out of the artifact summary block, and Pi does **not** auto-inline the diff the way it inlines trusted `screenshot` captures. `state load` may print the loaded path in prose but does not add a saved-file artifact entry the way `state save` does.

For screenshot paths under dot-directories such as `.dogfood/run/foo.png`, the wrapper normalizes the requested path to an absolute path before invoking upstream `agent-browser`, verifies the requested file exists, and repairs from an upstream temp screenshot when possible. For direct artifact commands and batch artifact steps (`download`, `pdf`, `screenshot`, `state save`, and `wait --download`), the wrapper creates missing parent directories before launch. A parent-directory failure returns `validation-error` with the attempted directory and `verify-artifact-path` guidance before the browser command runs. Use **absolute paths in raw batch artifact rows**: raw strings stay unchanged, and the daemon's working directory may differ from Pi's. Screenshot path normalization still applies only to direct calls and stdin rows. Known caller paths appear as `Requested path`; `Absolute path` is the resolved location checked on disk, and `Reported path` exposes a differing screenshot report (including a canonical `/private/tmp` alias) through the existing `tempPath` metadata. No extra canonicalization rewrites upstream arguments.

For annotated screenshots in `batch`, put `--annotate` in top-level args instead of inside the screenshot step:

```json
{ "args": ["--annotate", "batch"], "stdin": "[[\"screenshot\",\"/tmp/page.png\"]]" }
```

#### Recording quality and receipts

```json
{ "args": ["record", "start", "captures/demo.webm", "--fps", "30"] }
{ "args": ["record", "stop"], "outputPath": "captures/demo-receipt.json" }
```

Inspect `details.artifacts[].recording`: native capture start/end and first/last frame timestamps, wall duration, captured-frame rate, received frames, encoded/written/held/dropped/skipped counts, and separate output duration/FPS. Received frames are not pixel-unique. Repeated/static or late/final-only frames cannot establish smoothness. Missing metrics stay unknown; nominal FPS and `frames / fps` are not wall-clock capture evidence.

A stop timeout or `No recording in progress` result triggers one two-second native `session info` query, not another stop. `details.recordingRecovery` keeps the original failed attempt and requires matching session/namespace, recording ID/path (or an effective planned start window), terminal native encoder success and a verified file before recovering success. Same-path older receipts cannot verify a newer take. A timed-out batch may yield a verified recording while other steps remain unproven; unrelated failed-step repair actions remain available. Failed or unverified receipts still export safely to a distinct `outputPath`, with error/attempt provenance and parseable JSON. Follow the returned status/stop actions, not blind mutation retries or longer timeouts.

Detailed receipt/live-browser fields and browser-independent native read/confirm handling require companion upstream support not yet present in the current recommended release. Older supported versions remain usable with unknown metrics. Native receipt lookup lasts only while that daemon retains its memory; transcript metadata is not post-exit native recovery. See [the full receipt contract](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#recording-receipts-and-recovery).

#### Artifact retention and dogfood-heavy QA runs

The wrapper keeps a bounded, metadata-only `details.artifactManifest` of recent artifacts so long sessions do not grow unbounded. The default recent window is 100 entries and can be raised for screenshot/video-heavy QA sessions with `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST_MAX_ENTRIES=<count>`.

This manifest cap controls what appears in `details.artifactManifest` and in summaries such as `Session artifacts: 42 live, 0 evicted (42/100 recent)`. It does not delete explicit files that upstream saved to paths you chose, such as screenshots, PDFs, downloads, traces, HAR files, or WebM recordings.

Browser close commands (`close`, `quit`, or `exit`) are also not file cleanup. If `details.artifactManifest` is present with a non-empty `entries` list, a successful close command appends a compact `Artifact lifecycle` note and reports `details.artifactCleanup` with the current retention summary and the same host-owned cleanup `note` as the contract (`extensions/agent-browser/lib/orchestration/browser-run/diagnostics.ts`, `getArtifactCleanupGuidance`). Up to ten distinct user-chosen paths that still exist on disk appear in `explicitArtifactPaths` when matching `explicit-path` manifest rows exist in the recent window; deleted/stale paths are skipped. Otherwise that array is empty and the visible text stays compact while the structured detail still reminds you that close commands do not delete saved files. Delete any paths you care about with host file tools after inspection; the native browser tool intentionally does not remove arbitrary user-chosen filesystem paths.

Oversized snapshots and oversized generic outputs are different: when a persisted pi session is available, their wrapper-managed spill files are stored under the private session artifact directory and are governed by the byte budget `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION_ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES` (default 32 MiB). Raise that byte budget for longer retention, or set `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION_ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES=0` to disable automatic eviction of persistent spill files. Zero leaves existing files in place as new spills are written; it does not recover files already evicted or change temporary subprocess spill cleanup.

### Switch from an already-active implicit session to a fresh profiled or alternate-browser launch

```json
{
  "args": ["--profile", "Profile 1", "open", "https://mail.google.com"],
  "sessionMode": "fresh"
}
```

```json
{
  "args": ["--executable-path", "/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser", "open", "https://mail.google.com"],
  "sessionMode": "fresh"
}
```

`profiles` lists Chrome profile directory names from Chrome's user data directory; `Default` is common but not guaranteed. When profile resolution fails, use `agent_browser` diagnostics first: run `{ "args": ["profiles"] }` and `{ "args": ["doctor"] }`, then tell the user which profile name/path or browser executable setting to configure before retrying. For non-Chrome Chromium browsers, pass `--executable-path <path>` to the browser binary and use a full profile/user-data directory path only when upstream accepts that path.

### Recover tabs when focus lands somewhere unexpected

```json
{ "args": ["tab", "list"] }
{ "args": ["tab", "t2"] }
{ "args": ["snapshot", "-i"] }
```

Use `tab list` and `tab <tab-id-or-label>` when a profile restore, pop-up, or click opens or focuses the wrong tab. Wrapper presentation keeps stable tab IDs plus upstream labels from `tab new --label` visible (for example `label=docs`) so multi-tab sessions are easier to read. Generic tab-drift recovery lists tabs first; run `snapshot -i` only after selecting or confirming the intended stable target. When the wrapper already knows the target, `details.nextActions` may include recovery actions that list tabs, select the intended tab, and refresh refs in the right session.

### Recover from guarded-action confirmations

When a call uses `--confirm-actions` and upstream requires confirmation, the native tool result prints the pending confirmation id and both recovery calls. Use the same `agent_browser` tool; do not switch to bash.

```json
{ "args": ["--confirm-actions", "click", "click", "@danger"] }
```

If the result says `Pending confirmation id: c_8f3a1234`, choose one follow-up:

```json
{ "args": ["confirm", "c_8f3a1234"] }
{ "args": ["deny", "c_8f3a1234"] }
```

For a policy-required explicit URL read, use the returned actions: they name the actual native namespace/session, including `default`, and this routing survives resume/branch replay. The wrapper skips page helpers on matching confirm/deny only when the native read response also advertises `capabilities.readRequiresConfirmation: true`, which includes strict native ID matching. Legacy read prompts retain correct routing but normal page checks; DOM or page-content-shaped prompts never gain the exemption. Explicit caller identities and script isolation still win.

Confirmation context may be redacted when it contains credentials, tokens, cookies, or auth-bearing URLs. Replacements are marked `[REDACTED]` (URL-encoded in parsed URLs); ordinary technical phrases such as `bearer token` and `bearer authentication` stay intact outside credential fields and headers. URL scrubbing covers `code`, SAMLRequest, SAMLResponse, RelayState, `authorization_session_id`, and auth-context `state` / `nonce` while retaining ordinary non-auth query values and the spelling of URLs needing no redaction. Visible text, structured details, persisted spills, and `outputPath` exports use the same redaction; exact internal page-target URLs remain available to browser state logic. Use the id exactly as printed.

### Use stateful browser-context commands safely

Stateful commands are native `agent_browser` calls, not shell commands. Keep secrets out of `args` whenever upstream supports stdin, and expect model-facing summaries to redact auth, cookie, password, secret, session, and token-like values.

```json
{ "args": ["auth", "save", "demo", "--password-stdin"], "stdin": "password from the user-approved secret source" }
{ "args": ["auth", "login", "demo"] }
{ "args": ["state", "save", "/tmp/demo-state.json"] }
{ "args": ["state", "load", "/tmp/demo-state.json"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }
{ "args": ["cookies", "set", "theme", "dark", "--url", "https://example.com"] }
{ "args": ["storage", "local", "get", "theme"] }
{ "args": ["dialog", "status"] }
{ "args": ["dialog", "accept", "prompt text"] }
{ "args": ["frame", "main"] }
```

Operational notes:

- Visible page content from real authenticated profiles is still model-visible and may persist in transcripts or saved artifacts. The wrapper redacts credential-like cookie/storage/auth data, not the ordinary page text you asked it to read.
- `stdin` is accepted only for `batch`, `eval --stdin`, and `auth save --password-stdin`; other stdin-bearing calls are rejected before launch.
- `auth list/show/save/login/delete` summaries avoid expanding profile secrets. Prefer `auth save --password-stdin` over `--password <value>`.
- `session list` and `tab list` are formatted as compact field lists so caller-owned names, labels, active markers, page titles, and URLs are visible without relying on raw JSON. Wrapper-managed `piab-*` session rows are removed from `session list`.
- `state save <path>` is a verified file-artifact workflow; the wrapper creates missing parent directories before invoking upstream, then inspect `details.artifactVerification` before relying on the file. `state load <path>` is not treated as a newly saved artifact.
- `cookies get` can expose real authenticated-profile cookies; prefer task-specific page actions and only inspect cookies when the user needs cookie data.
- `storage local|session` summaries redact sensitive keys and likely secret values but may keep benign primitive local QA values visible, for example `theme: dark`; still avoid broad storage dumps unless necessary.
- `dialog accept/dismiss/status`, `frame <selector|main>`, and guarded-action `confirm <id>` / `deny <id>` pass through the native tool. Dialog commands use a shorter wrapper process timeout than general browser calls; if a click/tap/find/dialog command times out and may be blocked behind a JavaScript dialog, `details.nextActions` can include `inspect-dialog-after-timeout`, `dismiss-dialog-after-timeout`, and `recover-fresh-session-after-dialog-timeout`. Prefer `details.nextActions` for exact confirmation recovery payloads.
- `batch` mirrors the same redaction on every step: top-level `details.data` is a compact `{ success, command, result?, error? }[]` matrix (argv-redacted `command`, stateful `result`, scrubbed `error` text). Use `details.batchSteps[]` when you need per-step artifacts, categories, spill paths, or full structured errors beyond the roll-up.

## Full supported surface

The tables below intentionally list more than the recommended workflow. Rare commands are included so agents can discover that the installed upstream supports them without direct `agent-browser --help` access.

### Built-in skills

Native-tool note: upstream skills are written for the standalone `agent-browser` CLI and may show bash/heredoc examples. In pi, convert those examples to `agent_browser` calls: pass CLI tokens in `args`, and pass heredoc/stdin bodies through the tool `stdin` field for `batch`, `eval --stdin`, or `auth save --password-stdin`.

Session note: `skills list`, `skills get …`, and `skills path …` are **stateless** in this wrapper. Even with default `sessionMode: "auto"`, the extension does not prepend the implicit managed `--session` for those commands, so reading bundled skills does not attach to or rotate the active browser session (same intent as plain-text `--help` / `--version` inspection). Other `skills` subcommands follow normal session rules until explicitly allowlisted in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/runtime.ts` alongside regression coverage in `test/agent-browser.runtime.test.ts`.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `skills list` | List available CLI-bundled skills. |
| `skills get core` | Print the core usage guide. |
| `skills get core --full` | Print the full version-matched core command reference and templates. |
| `skills get <name>` | Load a specialized skill such as `electron` or `slack`. Common specialized calls include `skills get electron`, `skills get slack`, `skills get dogfood`, `skills get vercel-sandbox`, `skills get agentcore`, `skills get derive-client` (HAR-to-API-client workflow), and `skills get webmcp-gen` (create and validate page tools). |
| `skills get <name> --full` | Include a skill's supplementary references/templates when present. |
| `skills get --all` | Print all visible bundled skills for broad audit/debug work. |
| `skills path [name]` | Print a skill directory path. |

Skill-source debugging note: upstream honors `AGENT_BROWSER_SKILLS_DIR` as an override for bundled skill discovery. Normal agents should not need it, but it is useful when validating package layout or upstream skill packaging.

### Core page and element commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `open [url]` | Launch the browser and optionally navigate. URL-less `open` stays on `about:blank` so agents can stage routes, cookies, or init scripts before first navigation. |
| `open <url>` | Navigate to a URL; `goto <url>` and `navigate <url>` are equivalent navigation aliases when a URL is present. |
| `read [url]` | Fetch agent-readable text from an explicit URL without requiring a Chrome page, or omit the URL to read rendered active-tab DOM. Supports `--raw`, `--require-md`, `--llms <index|full>`, `--outline`, `--filter <text>`, and `--timeout <ms>`. |
| `click <sel>` | Click an element or `@ref`. |
| `click <sel> --new-tab` | Click a link/control while requesting a new tab. |
| `dblclick <sel>` | Double-click an element. |
| `type <sel> <text>` | Type into an element; both selector and text are required. For the focused element without a selector, use `keyboard type <text>`. |
| `fill <sel> <text>` | Clear and fill an element. |
| `press <key>` | Press a key such as `Enter`, `Tab`, or `Control+a`. `key <key>` is the upstream alias. |
| `key <key>` | Alias for `press <key>`. |
| `keydown <key>` | Hold a key down without releasing it, useful for modifiers. |
| `keyup <key>` | Release a key previously held by `keydown <key>`. Common modifier examples are `keydown Shift` and `keyup Shift`. |
| `keyboard type <text>` | Type text with real keystrokes and no selector. |
| `keyboard inserttext <text>` | Insert text without key events. |
| `hover <sel>` | Hover an element. |
| `focus <sel>` | Focus an element. |
| `check <sel>` | Check a checkbox. |
| `uncheck <sel>` | Uncheck a checkbox. |
| `select <sel> <val...>` | Select one or more dropdown options. |
| `drag <src> <dst>` | Drag and drop. |
| `upload <sel> <files...>` | Upload one or more files. |
| `download <sel> <path>` | Download a file by clicking an element. |
| `scroll <dir> [px]` | Scroll `up`, `down`, `left`, or `right`. |
| `scroll <dir> [px] --selector <sel>` | Scroll a specific scrollable element/container instead of the page. |
| `scrollintoview <sel>` | Scroll an element into view; `scrollinto <sel>` is the upstream alias. |
| `scrollinto <sel>` | Alias for `scrollintoview <sel>`. |
| `wait <sel|ms>` | Wait for an element or a duration. |
| `screenshot [selector] [path]` | Take a full-page or element-scoped screenshot; a single selector-like argument scopes, while a path-like argument saves to that path. |
| `screenshot [path]` | Take a screenshot and optionally save it to a path. |
| `pdf <path>` | Save the page as a PDF. |
| `snapshot` | Print an accessibility tree with refs for AI interaction. Common options include `snapshot --interactive`, `snapshot --urls`, `snapshot --compact`, `snapshot --depth <n>`, `snapshot --selector <sel>`, and `snapshot --cursor` / `snapshot -C` for cursor/focus context when upstream returns it. |
| `eval <js>` | Run JavaScript. Use `eval --stdin` through this wrapper for larger snippets, or `eval -b <base64>` for shell-escaping-safe one-liners. |
| `connect <port|url>` | Connect to a browser through CDP. |
| `close [--all]` | Close the current browser or all sessions; `quit` and `exit` are upstream close aliases. |
| `tap <selector>` | Touch-oriented tap alias for iOS/provider workflows. |
| `swipe <direction> [distance]` | Touch-oriented swipe for iOS/provider workflows. |

On dashboards and other apps with nested scroll containers, `scroll <dir> [px]` can miss because a page-level wheel does not move the document or the intended pane. Without startup-scoped launch flags, the wrapper first applies ordinary `scroll <up|down|left|right> [px|percent]` directly to `document.scrollingElement` with smooth scrolling temporarily disabled; successful movement reports `details.scrollPage`. If the document cannot move, it falls back to upstream wheel behavior. For large fallback calls on an existing or fresh managed session, the wrapper samples viewport and prominent scroll-container positions before and after the command; when nothing changes it reclassifies the nominal upstream success as `failureCategory: "upstream-error"`, prepends `Scroll completed with no observed movement`, appends `Scroll diagnostic: no observed scroll movement`, exposes `details.scrollNoop`, marks `details.data.scrolled: false`, and adds exact `details.nextActions` for a fresh `snapshot -i` and screenshot. Explicit CSS-container calls `scroll <selector> <up|down|left|right> [px|percent]` remain wrapper-handled and report `details.scrollContainer`; `scroll to end` / `scroll to top` report `details.scrollPage`. Calls with startup-scoped flags skip all helper shims so the requested launch configuration runs first. Use these paths before repeating page scrolls; when you need a specific element, prefer `scrollintoview <@ref>` or target the actual scrollable region. Do not pass `text=...` to `scrollintoview`: the wrapper rejects that upstream false-success path and returns `scroll-semantic-text-target` (`find text ... hover`) plus `refresh-refs-for-scroll-target` (`snapshot -i`) actions.

Comboboxes vary by app. For native `<select>` controls, prefer raw `select <selector> <value...>`, direct `semanticAction: { action: "select", selector, value|values }`, active-session semantic role/name or label select, or a `job` `select` step instead of clicking option refs; native option refs can be non-boxed in CDP and fail before a real selection. A `click` or `semanticAction` role/name click may focus a searchable custom combobox without opening its option list. For explicit combobox-targeted actions such as `semanticAction` role `combobox`, the wrapper checks whether a combobox-like element is focused, has explicit `aria-expanded` state, and has no visible listbox/options open; this still applies when the semantic action first resolves to a current visible `@ref` before execution. When that happens it appends `Combobox diagnostic: focused combobox did not expose visible options`, exposes `details.comboboxFocus`, and adds exact `details.nextActions` for a fresh `snapshot -i`, `press ArrowDown`, and `press Enter`. Use those instead of assuming click alone expanded the control. To search the focused input, use `keyboard type <text>`; raw `type` requires both a selector and text. Reserve visible option refs for custom comboboxes after a fresh snapshot shows the intended option.

### Navigation

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `back` | Go back. |
| `forward` | Go forward. |
| `reload` | Reload the current page. |

### Session, state, frames, dialogs, windows, and inspection commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `session` | Show current session name. |
| `session list` | List active sessions. |
| `state save <path>` | Save cookies, local storage, and session storage to a state file. |
| `state load <path>` | Load cookies and storage from a state file. |
| `state list` | List saved state files. |
| `state show <filename>` | Show saved-state metadata without dumping cookie or storage values. |
| `state rename <old-name> <new-name>` | Rename a saved state file. |
| `state clear [session-name] [--all]` | Clear saved states for one name or all names; `state clear -a` is the upstream short alias for clearing all names. |
| `session id --scope worktree --prefix <name>` | Generate a stable session id for agent/worktree-scoped browser state. |
| `session info --json` | One read-only preflight: daemon activity/PID versus native browser liveness, Chrome PID, exact profile, tabs and launched/attached ownership, plus separate Pi cleanup ownership. Missing native fields remain unknown; no browser launch or tab changes. |
| `state clean --older-than <days>` | Delete expired saved-state files. |
| `frame <selector|main>` | Switch iframe context by selector/ref/name/URL, or return to the main frame. |
| `dialog accept [text]` | Accept an alert, confirm, or prompt dialog, optionally supplying prompt text. |
| `dialog dismiss` | Dismiss or cancel the current dialog. |
| `dialog status` | Check whether a dialog is pending. |
| `window new` | Open and activate a new blank window. The wrapper keeps that intentional `about:blank` target rather than selecting the old tab. Old refs are invalid; take a fresh snapshot before further interaction. |
| `close` | Close the current browser session. |
| `close --all` | Close every session. |

A canceled cold-session reopen returns an aborted result with its exact session identity and the consumed reopen marker once the CLI starts. Reload does not repeat that navigation. Cancellation before the attempt leaves the remembered URL pending for the next current-page operation.

<!-- agent-browser-playbook:start inspection -->
<!-- Generated from extensions/agent-browser/lib/playbook.ts. Run `npm run docs -- playbook write` to update. -->
Native inspection calls use the `agent_browser` tool shape, not shell-like direct-binary commands:

- { "args": ["--help"] }
- { "args": ["--version"] }

These calls return plain text and stay stateless: the extension does not inject its implicit session and does not let inspection consume the managed-session slot needed for later profile, session, CDP, state, auto-connect, or provider-backed launches.
<!-- agent-browser-playbook:end inspection -->

### Page state, finding, mouse, settings, network, and storage

| Family | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `get title`, `get url`, `get cdp-url` | Read page/browser metadata without a selector. Upstream root help summarizes this family as `get <what> [selector]`, but the selector is not optional for DOM getters. |
| `get text/html/value/count <selector>` | Read matched elements; use `get text body` for whole-page text. |
| `get attr <selector> <name>`, `get box <selector>`, `get styles <selector>` | Read an attribute, bounding box, or computed styles from matched elements. |
| `is <what> <selector>` | Check `visible`, `enabled`, or `checked`. |
| `find <locator> <value> <action> [text]` | Locator types include `role`, `text`, `label`, `placeholder`, `alt`, `title`, and `testid`; selector helpers include `find first <sel>`, `find last <sel>`, and `find nth <n> <sel>`. Role/text filters include `find role <role> --name <name>` and `find ... --exact`. Actions are `click, fill, check, hover, text` only. Prefer `find role` for semantic elements: implicit roles work (`find role heading text --name` for `<h2>`, list/banner landmarks, and similar). Default name matching is a case-insensitive substring; `--exact` makes the accessible name case-sensitive. On misses, upstream 0.32.4+ keeps locator detail such as `Names seen: …` or `No element found: getByRole(...)` instead of a generic flatten. |
| `mouse <action> [args]` | `move <x> <y>`, `down [btn]`, `up [btn]`, `wheel <dy> [dx]`. |
| `set <setting> [value]` | `viewport <w> <h>`, `device <name>`, `geo <lat> <lng>`, `offline [on|off]`, `headers <json>`, `credentials <user> <pass>`, and `set media <features>` (`dark`, `light`, and/or `reduced-motion`). |
| `network <action>` | `network route <url> [--abort|--body <json>] [--resource-type <csv>]`, `network unroute [url]`, `network requests [--clear] [--filter <pattern>] [--type <csv>] [--method <method>] [--status <code|range>]`, `network request <requestId>`, `network har start`, `network har start --content text` (default; embeds text bodies), `network har start --content all`, `network har start --content none`, and `network har stop [path]`. `--resource-type` filters intercepted requests by CDP resource type, such as `script`, `image`, `font`, `xhr`, or `fetch`; request listing filters accept resource types (`xhr,fetch`), methods (`POST`), and statuses (`2xx`, `400-499`). HAR files can include auth headers and bodies—do not share them unredacted. For turning a recording into a reusable API client, load `skills get derive-client`. |
| `cookies [get|set|clear]` | Manage cookies. Full set form: `cookies set <name> <value> --url <url> --domain <domain> --path <path> --httpOnly --secure --sameSite <Strict|Lax|None> --expires <timestamp>`; also supports `cookies set --curl <file>` for JSON, cURL, or bare Cookie-header bulk imports. |
| `storage <local|session>` | Manage web storage. |

Privacy note: `cookies get` can expose real profile cookies. Do not run it against `--profile Default` or other authenticated profiles unless the user explicitly needs cookie inspection; prefer task-specific page actions and storage checks.

### WebMCP page tools

WebMCP support is experimental and browser-dependent. Locally managed Chrome enables it by default; use a fresh launch with `--no-webmcp` or set `AGENT_BROWSER_NO_WEBMCP=1` to disable it. Page tool metadata and results come from the page itself. On 0.37, successful navigation with native `webmcp.available: true` and a positive tool count shows a `webmcp list` hint; the raw object stays in `details.data`. No hint is added for absent, unavailable or empty metadata.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `webmcp list` | List tools registered by the current page, including each tool's frame id, origin, schema, and annotations. |
| `webmcp invoke <tool>` | Invoke a page tool with an empty input object. |
| `webmcp invoke <tool> --params <json|@file>` | Pass a JSON object inline or read it from a caller-selected file. |
| `webmcp invoke <tool> --frame <frame-id>` | Select the registering frame when a tool name is ambiguous. |
| `webmcp invoke <tool> --detach` | Start the call and return its invocation id without waiting. |
| `webmcp invoke <tool> --timeout <ms>` | Bound a blocking invocation in milliseconds. |
| `webmcp result <id>` | Wait for or read a detached invocation result; accepts `--timeout <ms>`. |
| `webmcp cancel <id>` | Cancel an active detached invocation. |

`webmcp invoke`, `webmcp result`, and `webmcp cancel` can run page code that changes or navigates the document. The wrapper refreshes page-target evidence and invalidates prior `@e…` refs after these commands. A detached invocation that still reports `pending`, or fails to settle while its target is unknown, leaves the target unverified rather than trusting the immediate URL probe; `result`, `cancel`, `get url`, and explicit navigation remain available for recovery. `details.nextActions` replaces the blocked snapshot suggestion with `verify-page-target-after-pending-webmcp` (`get url`) and warns that the detached tool remains unsettled. After a completed WebMCP mutation, run `snapshot -i` before reusing refs; inside `batch --bail`, put `get url` before that snapshot. `webmcp list` does not invalidate refs. Attached browsers, providers, Lightpanda, Safari/iOS, and Chrome builds without the experimental CDP domain may return `webmcp_unsupported`.

### Tabs

Stable tab ids look like `t1`, `t2`, and `t3`. Optional user labels such as `docs` or `app` are interchangeable with ids wherever a tab reference is accepted. Upstream help may refer to numeric tab positions, but this wrapper guidance uses stable `t<N>` ids because positional integers are not accepted by current upstream `agent-browser`.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tab` | List open tabs by default. |
| `tab list` | List open tabs with ids and labels. |
| `tab new [url]` | Open a new tab. |
| `tab new --label <name> [url]` | Open a new tab with a user label. |
| `tab <t<N>|label>` | Switch to a tab by id or label. CDP target ids from `tab list --json` are also accepted and stay stable across daemon restarts. |
| `tab close [t<N>|label|target]` | Close the current tab or a referenced tab. Generic references in workflows may say `tab close [target]`; use a stable `t<N>` id, label, or CDP target id when you have one. |

After successful standalone tab selection or close, the wrapper live-probes `get url` and, for non-blank pages, `get title` before committing the active target. Tab transitions always refresh the title even when the URL matches the prior tab, and an explicit selection of an existing `about:blank` tab or a close that reveals one remains on that live target instead of triggering prior-tab correction. A successful probe clears the unverified-page gate for the next command; if the probe fails, `details.sessionTabTargetUnknown` stays true and recovery still starts with `get url`.

With `--pin-tab`, a closed bound tab fails as `tab_gone` (`data.targetId`, optional `data.lastUrl`) instead of falling back to another tab.

### Snapshot

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `snapshot` | Full accessibility tree with refs. |
| `snapshot -i` / `snapshot --interactive` | Include only interactive elements. |
| `snapshot -i --urls` | Include only interactive elements and link hrefs. |
| `snapshot -u` / `snapshot --urls` | Include href URLs for link elements. |
| `snapshot -C` / `snapshot --cursor` | Include cursor/focus context when upstream provides it. |
| `snapshot -c` / `snapshot --compact` | Remove empty structural elements. |
| `snapshot -d <n>` / `snapshot --depth <n>` | Limit tree depth. |
| `snapshot -s <sel>` / `snapshot --selector <sel>` | Scope to a CSS selector. |

When a snapshot is too large for inline output, the Pi wrapper renders a compact view before spilling the full redacted snapshot to `details.fullOutputPath`. Compact snapshots are main-content-first, but dense pages and desktop host screens can still hide actionable controls in omitted content; scan `Omitted high-value controls` before opening the spill file. That bounded section favors editable/searchbox/textbox/combobox controls, named tab/surface controls, primary action buttons, and named action links such as row/navigation links and repository-style result links, then includes other useful controls such as checkboxes, radios, options, and menuitems that were not already listed under key refs or other refs. When that section appears, `details.data.highValueControlRefIds` repeats the same visible ref ids for programmatic follow-up alongside fields such as `previewMode`, `previewSections`, and counts on `details.data` (see [`TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](TOOL_CONTRACT.md#details)).

For dense pages, the wrapper also accepts `snapshot -i --search <text>` and `snapshot -i --filter role=<role>` as wrapper-side filters. It runs upstream `snapshot` without those wrapper-only flags, records the full returned ref map in `details.refSnapshot` for stale-ref safety, and renders matching direct refs plus surrounding snapshot context in the model-visible snapshot with `details.snapshotFilter` counts. Search also runs one bounded read-only rendered-DOM text probe across the full document, including below-fold content and accessible labels, so visible warnings or label-only controls omitted from the accessibility snapshot still surface under `Rendered page text matches`; hidden elements stay excluded. The visible summary distinguishes direct ref matches from rendered-text/context matches so contextual output does not look like a ref-count mismatch. Add wrapper-side `--viewport` when scroll position, viewport size, document size, and sampled scroll-container offsets matter; it runs one read-only `eval --stdin` probe and reports `details.snapshotViewport`. Add wrapper-side `--diff` to compare the current ref map with the previous wrapper-tracked snapshot for that session and report `details.snapshotDiff` added/removed/changed refs. Use these flags when you need controls like checkout buttons, all comboboxes, above/below-fold context, or a quick before/after ref delta without reading a full spill file.

### Wait

| Mode | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `wait <selector>` | Wait for an element to appear. |
| `wait <ms>` | Wait for a fixed number of milliseconds; the duration is positional, not `--time <ms>`. The native Pi wrapper now forwards long waits and derives a subprocess watchdog from the explicit wait duration when the caller does not provide top-level `timeoutMs`. |
| `wait --url <pattern>` | Wait for the URL to match a pattern. On timeout the wrapper appends a `fresh-session-after-url-wait-timeout` next action (`sessionMode: "fresh"` + `open about:blank`, after the inspect action): if a preceding click or submit reported success but the page never navigated, upstream click dispatch may have silently missed, so replace about:blank with the target URL and replay the flow as one batch in a fresh session instead of retrying the wait. |
| `wait --load <state>` | Wait for load state: `load`, `domcontentloaded`, or `networkidle`. |
| `wait --fn <expression>` | Wait for a JavaScript expression to become truthy. |
| `wait --text <text>` | Wait for text to appear on the page; failures may include `inspect-after-text-assertion-failure` with a session-scoped `snapshot -i` payload. |
| `wait --download [path]` | Wait for a download started by a previous action and optionally save it to `path`; successful wrapper results include upstream-reported `savedFilePath`/`savedFile`, while `details.artifacts[].exists` is the wrapper's on-disk verification signal. |
| `wait --download [path] --timeout <ms>` | Set download-start timeout in milliseconds. The native Pi wrapper forwards explicit wait timeouts and extends the subprocess watchdog unless the caller supplies top-level `timeoutMs`. |

Current upstream still does not parse `wait <selector> --state hidden` / `wait <selector> --state detached` as distinct wait modes even though upstream help mentions those examples. Use `wait --fn "!document.querySelector('#spinner')"` or another explicit JavaScript predicate for disappearance/detach checks until upstream parser support exists.

### Diff, debug, and streaming

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `diff snapshot` | Compare current versus last snapshot. Use `diff snapshot --baseline <file> --selector <sel> --compact --depth <n>` when you need a saved baseline, scoped subtree, compact output, or depth bound. |
| `diff screenshot --baseline` | Compare current screenshot versus a baseline image. Use `diff screenshot --baseline <file> --output <file> --threshold <0-1> --selector <sel> --full` when you need a saved diff image, threshold tuning, element scope, or full-page capture. |
| `diff url <u1> <u2>` | Navigate to both pages and compare them, leaving the second destination active. The wrapper observes the final URL, including redirects to `about:blank`, and invalidates old refs without recovering the old tab; direct and reached batch rows use the same rule. If the URL cannot be observed, run `get url` before taking a fresh snapshot. Use `diff url <u1> <u2> --screenshot --wait-until <strategy> --selector <sel> --compact --depth <n>` when you need screenshot comparison, navigation wait control, or scoped/compact snapshot comparison. |
| `trace start`, `trace stop [path]` | Record a Chrome DevTools trace. |
| `profiler start|stop [path]` | Record a Chrome DevTools profile. |
| `record start <path> [url]` | Record the active page; an optional URL navigates first. Use `.webm` or `.mp4` and optional `--fps <n>` (1–60, default 30); native validates startup and requires `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. Verify output after `record stop`. |
| `record stop` | Finalize video and inspect its native receipt plus wrapper file verification. A failed or recovered stop retains original attempt evidence; use a distinct top-level `outputPath` to save its receipt. |
| `record restart <path> [url]` | Stop any current recording and start a new video. Supports the same formats and `--fps` option; without a URL it keeps the page and refs. |
| `console [--clear]` | View or clear console logs. |
| `errors [--clear]` | View or clear page errors. |
| `highlight <sel>` | Highlight an element. |
| `inspect` | Open Chrome DevTools for the active page. |
| `clipboard <op> [text]` | Read/write clipboard: `clipboard read`, `clipboard write <text>`, `clipboard copy`, and `clipboard paste`. Clipboard access is environment-dependent; `NotAllowedError` / permission-denied failures are common in headless, managed-profile, remote, or `file://` sessions. |
| `stream enable [--port <n>]` | Start runtime WebSocket streaming for this session. If upstream reports that streaming is already enabled, the wrapper treats it as an idempotent success and adds status/disable follow-ups. |
| `stream disable` | Stop runtime WebSocket streaming. |
| `stream status` | Show streaming status and active port. |
| `react tree` | Print the full React component tree. Requires the page to have been launched with `--enable react-devtools`. |
| `react inspect <id>` | Inspect one React fiber's props, hooks, state, and source. |
| `react renders start` | Start recording React render activity. |
| `react renders stop [--json]` | Stop render recording and print mount/re-render counts and changed details. |
| `react suspense [--only-dynamic] [--json]` | Classify Suspense boundaries with grouped root-cause recommendations. |
| `a11y [url]` | Run an embedded axe-core accessibility audit on the current page, or navigate to `url` first. Options: `a11y --tags wcag2a,wcag2aa`, `a11y --selector "#main"`. CDP browsers only (not Safari/iOS WebDriver). Model-facing text summarizes violation/incomplete counts and top rules; full node targets stay in `details.data`. |
| `vitals [url] [--json]` | Report Core Web Vitals: LCP, CLS, TTFB, FCP, INP, plus React hydration timing when available. `web-vitals [url] [--json]` is the upstream alias. |
| `pushstate <url>` | Perform SPA client-side navigation; detects Next.js router pushes and falls back to history navigation events. |
| `removeinitscript <id>` | Remove an init script registered through upstream init-script mechanisms. |

Recording destinations are reserved within one Pi process, not across processes. Use unique paths for concurrent Pi processes: different explicit sessions can overwrite one file even when both `record stop` results are verified. Upstream’s same-session `record start` guard does not reserve the filename across other sessions.

When these diagnostic commands are invoked through the native `agent_browser` tool, structured console, page-error, React, Web Vitals, and SPA outputs render as compact summaries when possible, with large outputs previewed and spilled instead of dumped into context. Large outputs are previewed with a `Full output path:` spill file instead of dumping the entire payload into context. Artifact-producing commands such as `network har stop`, `diff screenshot`, `trace stop`, `profiler stop`, and `record stop` report `details.artifacts[]` plus `details.artifactVerification`; `record start` / `record restart` are reported as pending until `record stop` completes. For video workflows, keep `ffmpeg` on `PATH` first; on macOS with Homebrew, `brew install ffmpeg` or `brew install ffmpeg-full` is sufficient. Native 0.37 checks `ffmpeg` before capture and native `doctor` checks its encoders. Older supported natives may report pending output first; `details.recordingDependencyWarning` marks that output unverified, not recoverable merely by installing ffmpeg before stop. The README install section keeps the concise external-dependency list for maximal extension use.

Long-running or lifecycle commands should be explicitly paired with cleanup calls: `stream enable` → `stream disable`, `dashboard start` → `dashboard stop`, `trace start` → `trace stop`, `profiler start` → `profiler stop`, and `record start` → `record stop`. The wrapper keeps each subprocess bounded by its normal timeout; it does not keep an interactive `chat` REPL open, so prefer `chat <message>` with `--model` or `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL` for single-shot AI use.

`trace` and `profiler` share upstream Chrome tracing machinery. Do not run them at the same time. The wrapper tracks owner state it observes in the current Pi session and blocks conflicting starts/stops with "wrapper believes ..." wording because direct upstream CLI use or browser restarts can desynchronize wrapper-local state.

### Batch, auth, confirmations, sessions, chat, dashboard, devices, and setup

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `batch [--bail] ["cmd" ...]` | Execute multiple commands sequentially from args or stdin. |
| `auth save <name> [opts]` | Save an auth profile. Full credential form: `auth save <name> --url <url> --username <user> --password <pass>`; selector override form: `auth save <name> --username-selector <s> --password-selector <s> --submit-selector <s>`. Prefer `auth save <name> --password-stdin` with the tool `stdin` field; avoid putting passwords in `args`. |
| `auth login <name>` | Login using saved credentials. |
| `auth list` | List saved auth profiles. |
| `auth show <name>` | Show auth profile metadata. |
| `auth delete <name>` | Delete an auth profile; `auth remove <name>` is the upstream alias. |
| `confirm <id>` | Approve a pending action. |
| `deny <id>` | Deny a pending action. |
| `session` | Show current session name. |
| `session list` | List active sessions. |
| `chat <message>` | Send a natural-language instruction. |
| `chat` | Start interactive chat when stdin is a TTY. |
| `dashboard [start]` | Start the dashboard server on the default port `4848`. |
| `dashboard start --port <n>` | Start the dashboard on a specific port. |
| `dashboard start --allowed-origins <origins>` | Allow comma-separated exact HTTPS reverse-proxy origins. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. |
| `dashboard stop` | Stop the dashboard server. |
| `device list` | List available iOS simulators. Use with `-p ios` when exercising iOS provider flows. |
| `install` | Install browser binaries. |
| `install --with-deps` | Install browser binaries plus Linux system dependencies; exits nonzero when required libraries cannot be installed. |
| `upgrade` | Upgrade `agent-browser` using its detected package manager. Native output is text, even with `--json`; the wrapper displays it with surrounding whitespace trimmed and normal redaction, and exposes it in `details.data`. Caller-requested `--json` stays a parseable result with the text in `data`. Nonzero exits, spawn failures, timeout and cancellation remain failures; failed upgrade stdout and stderr remain available as diagnostics. |
| `doctor [--fix]` | Diagnose install issues and optionally auto-clean stale files. Use `doctor --offline --quick` for a fast local-only check and `doctor --json` for structured output. |
| `plugin add <ref>` | Add a plugin from npm or GitHub (`<owner>/<repo>` or `@scope/<name>`); writes `agent-browser.json`. Flags such as `--name`, `--capability`, `--global`, and `--no-manifest` shape discovery. |
| `plugin [list]` | List configured plugins (default subcommand); `{ "plugins": [...] }` is a successful sessionless result. |
| `plugin show <name>` | Show one configured plugin; `{ "plugin": {...} }` is a successful sessionless result. |
| `plugin run <name> <type>` | Run a `command.run` or custom plugin request over the agent-browser plugin stdio protocol. |
| `auth login <name> --credential-provider <plugin>` | Resolve credentials just-in-time from a configured credential plugin (e.g. a vault) instead of saved passwords; pair with `--item <ref>` and optional selector overrides. Credentials are not stored locally. |
| `mcp --help` | Show MCP server help through the native tool. |
| `mcp` | Start a local MCP stdio server for external MCP clients; bare native-tool calls are rejected before spawn. External clients can opt into experimental page tools with `mcp --tools core,webmcp`. |
| `profiles` | List available Chrome profiles. |

When these commands are invoked through the native `agent_browser` tool, structured diagnostic/status outputs are rendered as compact summaries. `session list` and `state list` keep every upstream row and restore identifier visible. Explicit sessions, state/restore paths, broad state lifecycle commands, config, local files, and launch environment pass through unchanged. Local inspection/setup calls remain sessionless unless you explicitly pass `--session`; browser-backed or context-dependent calls keep normal managed-session behavior when no explicit session is supplied. List-like outputs such as sessions, Chrome profiles, auth profiles, network requests, console messages, and page errors include counts and key fields; large outputs are previewed with a `Full output path:` spill file instead of dumping the entire payload into context. For `network requests`, the wrapper shows a failed-request summary split into actionable versus benign low-impact rows, then status, method, URL, resource/mime type, request id, and, when the installed upstream output includes body-like fields, bounded redacted payload, response, and failure/error snippets. Safe request IDs also produce `details.nextActions` for exact request details, actionable failed-request source lookup candidates, filtered request lists, or starting HAR capture before a repro. If the same session has active wrapper-observed network routes, failed/pending/CORS-looking matched request rows add `details.networkRouteDiagnostics` and executable route-mock next actions before the generic request actions. `data:image` artifact rows are omitted from compact request previews but remain in raw `details.data.requests`. `network request <requestId>` can expose upstream full-detail body fields such as response bodies using the same bounded model-facing preview; its request URL stays diagnostic-only and does not overwrite `details.sessionTabTarget` for later ref guards. Clipboard failures that mention `NotAllowedError` or permission denial are usually browser/OS capability limits, not proof that a read, paste, or page mutation happened; prefer page-native reads (`snapshot -i`, `get text`, `eval --stdin`) or direct typing (`keyboard inserttext` / `keyboard type`) when the workflow allows it, and retry true clipboard flows only from an allowed profile/session on a normal `http(s)` page. Header, cookie, auth, token, and other secret-like fields are not expanded in model-facing text or `details.data`; low-risk primitive storage values may remain visible, while command echoes still redact `--body`, `--headers`, `--password`, proxy credentials, auth-bearing URLs, `clipboard write` text, cookie/storage set values, and bearer/basic credential text in positional arguments. Use upstream HAR or full raw details only when complete data is required.

## Optional package config and companion web search

`pi-agent-browser-native` has package-owned config under Pi-scoped paths. This is separate from upstream `agent-browser` config and from Pi package settings:

- global: `~/.pi/config/pi-agent-browser-native/config.json`
- project-local: `.pi/config/pi-agent-browser-native/config.json`
- explicit override: `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json`

Get an Exa API key from the [Exa dashboard](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys) or a Brave Search API key from the [Brave Search API dashboard](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/). If both keys are available, `agent_browser_web_search` prefers Exa by default because its `/search` endpoint returns token-efficient highlights and agent-oriented search modes; set `webSearch.preferredProvider` to `"brave"` when Brave Search is preferred. You can also disable this package's search tool with `webSearch.enabled: false` when another search tool should win. Config merges global → project → `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG` override, so `enabled` is read from the final loaded config: a global disable can be re-enabled by project or override config, while an override file with `enabled: false` is the highest-priority hard disable for that run. Under Pi 0.84.0+, globally installed or CLI-loaded extensions are developer-trusted code, so this extension reads project-local config under `.pi/config/...` by default and skips that project layer when Pi reports the project is untrusted or when launched with `--no-approve`.

`pi install npm:pi-agent-browser-native` loads the extension, but it does **not** usually put the package helper on your shell `PATH`. The clearest setup is to write the config file directly and keep actual keys in the environment that launches `pi`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/config/pi-agent-browser-native
cat > ~/.pi/config/pi-agent-browser-native/config.json <<'JSON'
{
  "version": 1,
  "webSearch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "preferredProvider": "exa",
    "defaultSearchType": "deep-lite",
    "exaApiKey": "$EXA_API_KEY",
    "braveApiKey": "$BRAVE_API_KEY"
  }
}
JSON
```

`pi install` does not add package helper binaries to your shell `PATH`. Use direct JSON config edits, or run the helper only through `npm exec`:

```bash
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config paths
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config show
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config web-search set-env EXA_API_KEY --global
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config web-search set-env BRAVE_API_KEY --global
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config web-search set-env EXA_API_KEY --project
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config web-search prefer brave --global
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config web-search disable --global
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config web-search disable --project
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config web-search set-command "op read 'op://Private/Brave Search/API Key'" --provider brave --global
printf '%s' "$EXA_API_KEY" | npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config web-search set-key --provider exa --stdin
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config browser profile set "Profile 1" --policy authenticated-only
npm exec --yes --package pi-agent-browser-native@latest -- pi-agent-browser-config browser executable set "/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser"
```

The optional `agent_browser_web_search` tool is available when Exa or Brave credentials are visible from startup config or trusted session config and the runtime config has not set `webSearch.enabled` to `false`. It is a separate custom tool, not an `agent_browser` input mode, and does not launch a browser. Prefer it for current/live external web facts and URL discovery; use `agent_browser` for browser interaction, screenshots, authenticated/profile pages, and DOM inspection after you have a target URL. Prefer it over driving public search-engine forms such as Google with browser `job`/`type` flows, which can redirect headless automation to anti-bot or CAPTCHA pages; do not attempt CAPTCHA bypass. Disable scope is explicit: `web-search disable --global` sets the normal user default, `web-search disable --project` disables it for one repo, and a `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG` override containing `{ "version": 1, "webSearch": { "enabled": false } }` wins over both for a hard per-run disable. Loaded config may use plaintext, custom env aliases, interpolation literals, malformed-or-late-bound `$` values, and command-backed web-search keys; the resolved secret reaches the provider request while model-facing tool output and status text stay redacted. `web-search set-key`, `set-command`, and `clear` require `--provider`; `set-env` infers Exa/Brave from `EXA_API_KEY` or `BRAVE_API_KEY` unless you pass `--provider`.

For Exa, effective search type precedence is per-call `searchType` → `webSearch.defaultSearchType` → `auto`, with regular `contents.highlights: true`. Typical latencies are `instant` ~250 ms, `fast` ~450 ms, `auto` ~1 second, `deep-lite` ~4 seconds, `deep` 4–15 seconds, and `deep-reasoning` 12–40 seconds. Prefer `deep-lite` for research before implementation, `deep` for hard multi-source work, and `deep-reasoning` only for exhaustive or still-thin research. Searches are serialized; do not launch several in parallel.

```json
{
  "query": "pi-agent-browser-native agent_browser_web_search searchType defaults",
  "searchType": "deep-lite",
  "count": 5
}
```

Exa-only options include 1–20 `includeDomains` / `excludeDomains`, a six-value `category`, 1–10 deep-mode `additionalQueries`, and `highlightsDynamic`. The `company` and `people` categories cannot combine with `freshness` or `excludeDomains`; invalid combinations fail before the request. Explicit new Exa-only options also fail if Brave resolves as the provider, while the existing `searchType` field remains ignored by Brave. `highlightsDynamic: true` is a research preview and sends Exa's required beta header. Full page text and structured output schemas remain out of scope.

Every Exa request includes a fixed provider instruction to favor primary official sources, requested versions/dates, and distinct results. After normalization, both provider adapters remove later results only when their normalized URLs are exactly equal, retain the first row and provider order, and do not overfetch replacements or guess that distinct paths/query URLs are aliases. `details.duplicatesRemoved` reports removed rows, so returned results may be fewer than `count`. `pageDate` is Exa's estimated `publishedDate` or Brave's `page_age`; Brave may also supply `age`. Neither field proves crawl/retrieval age or a version match. When correctness or version matters, use the page/date clues, constrain one follow-up to the primary domain (`includeDomains` for Exa or `site:` in a Brave query), and read the primary page.

Example config:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "webSearch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "preferredProvider": "exa",
    "defaultSearchType": "deep-lite",
    "exaApiKey": "$EXA_API_KEY",
    "braveApiKey": "$BRAVE_API_KEY"
  },
  "browser": {
    "defaultProfile": {
      "name": "Profile 1",
      "policy": "authenticated-only"
    },
    "executablePath": "/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser"
  }
}
```

Browser default config is conservative: it adds agent guidance for signed-in/account-specific tasks and alternate Chromium-compatible executables; current releases do not auto-inject `--profile` or `--executable-path` for every launch. Configure profile/executable guidance globally, in trusted project config, or through `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG`. Ask the agent to run `profiles` and `doctor` when profile resolution fails, then use the reported Chrome profile directory name, a full profile/user-data directory path if upstream accepts one, or the configured `browser.executablePath` with top-level `sessionMode: "fresh"`.

## Important global flags, config, and environment

### Authentication and session flags

`agent-browser` 0.35.0 and newer require separate argv tokens for global flag values (for example, `--args <args>` and `--user-agent <ua>`). The explicit exception is `--restore=<key>`, which is supported when an optional restore key could otherwise be confused with a command word. The wrapper rejects other global `--flag=value` forms before normal command dispatch, including when they trail the command. Plain `--help`, `-h`, `--version`, and `-V` inspection preserves exact caller argv because upstream accepts those top-level inspection shapes. Global flags for `batch` belong before `batch` in top-level `args`; row-local equals forms are rejected without the help/version or `--restore=<key>` exceptions.

- `--profile <name|path>`: reuse Chrome profile login state by directory name from `profiles`, or use a persistent custom profile/profile-directory path when upstream accepts it. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_PROFILE`.
- `--session <name>`: use an isolated session. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION`. Native session names may begin with a hyphen; they remain values, not extra flags, including when selected through config or environment.
- `--restore [name]`: auto-save/restore cookies, local storage, and session storage; bare `--restore` uses `--session` as the key. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_RESTORE`. Wrapper-owned implicit sessions set a transcript- and checkout-scoped restore key automatically unless disabled with `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_MANAGED_SESSION_RESTORE=0` or suppressed by incompatible caller launch choices. Explicit restore/state/session/config choices pass through unchanged and remain visible in results. Automatic restore validates only its own checkout/storage identity and coordinates same-daemon reuse so wrapper restore pools cannot mix.
- `--restore-save <policy>` (`auto`, `always`, or `never`): restore auto-save policy. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_RESTORE_SAVE`. Restore-enabled sessions also save periodically while open; `AGENT_BROWSER_AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL_MS` sets the minimum interval in milliseconds (`30000` by default, `0` disables periodic saves but not save-on-close).
- `--restore-check-url <glob>`, `--restore-check-text <txt>`, `--restore-check-fn <js>`: validate restored state before auto-save. Environments: `AGENT_BROWSER_RESTORE_CHECK_URL`, `AGENT_BROWSER_RESTORE_CHECK_TEXT`, `AGENT_BROWSER_RESTORE_CHECK_FN`.
- `--namespace <name>`: isolate daemon sockets and restore-state directories. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_NAMESPACE`. Upstream and the wrapper canonicalize namespace identity to a lowercase sanitized component (for example, `Team Name` becomes `team-name`).
- `--session-name <name>`: legacy alias for restore persistence key. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION_NAME`.
- `--state <path>`: load saved auth state from JSON. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_STATE`.
- `--auto-connect`: connect to a running Chrome to reuse auth state. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_AUTO_CONNECT`. Optional booleans use separated tokens (`--auto-connect false`); the wrapper rejects `--auto-connect=false` before dispatch.
- `--pin-tab`: pin the session to its bound tab. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_PIN_TAB`. Sticky per session and not launch-scoped. Commands fail with `tab_gone` instead of falling back when that tab is closed. `--no-pin-tab` disables a previously enabled pin. Optional booleans use separated tokens (`--pin-tab false`).
- `--headers <json>`: apply HTTP headers scoped to the opened URL's origin.
- `--init-script <path>`: register a script before first navigation; repeatable. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_INIT_SCRIPTS`.
- `--enable <feature>`: enable built-in init scripts such as `react-devtools`; repeatable or comma-separated. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_ENABLE`.

### Browser launch and runtime flags

- `--executable-path <path>`: custom Chromium-compatible browser executable, such as Brave/Edge/Arc/Vivaldi when upstream can launch that binary. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`.
- `--extension <path>`: load browser extensions; repeatable. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_EXTENSIONS`.
- `--args <args>`: browser launch args, comma or newline separated. Chromium switches belong in this value, for example `{ "args": ["--args", "--no-sandbox", "open", "https://example.com"], "sessionMode": "fresh" }`. A bare `--no-sandbox` is diagnosed when it occupies the command slot (unknown command) or an `open` / `goto` / `navigate` option position (ignored by upstream); literal operands in other commands are left alone. For batches, put `--args` before `batch` in top-level `args`, not inside a row. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_ARGS`.
- `--user-agent <ua>`: custom user agent. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_USER_AGENT`.
- `--proxy <server>`: proxy server URL. Environments: `AGENT_BROWSER_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`.
- `--proxy-bypass <hosts>`: proxy bypass hosts. Environments: `AGENT_BROWSER_PROXY_BYPASS`, `NO_PROXY`.
- `--ignore-https-errors`: ignore HTTPS certificate errors. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_IGNORE_HTTPS_ERRORS`.
- `--ca-cert <path>`: trust a PEM bundle or DER certificate in an isolated NSS store for locally launched Linux Chromium. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_CA_CERT`. Use `sessionMode: "fresh"`; the wrapper disables automatic managed restore for the CA-enabled session while passing the caller-selected certificate path upstream. Upstream requires `certutil` and rejects profiles, CDP/auto-connect, providers, Lightpanda, `--ignore-https-errors`, macOS, and Windows.
- `--no-ca-cert`: clear retained CA trust. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_CLEAR_CA_CERT`. Use `sessionMode: "fresh"` for wrapper-managed sessions.
- `--allow-file-access`: upstream capability passed through unchanged from argv or `AGENT_BROWSER_ALLOW_FILE_ACCESS`. Raw `--args` / `AGENT_BROWSER_ARGS`, local file navigation, local-page follow-ups, and caller-selected paths remain upstream-owned. The wrapper adds only its fixed compatibility user-agent argument on eligible new managed launches; it does not clear or replace caller launch settings. Ambiguous page-target transitions still require `get url` before later content calls so the agent cannot silently act on the wrong page.
- `--hide-scrollbars <bool>`: explicitly show or hide native scrollbars in headless Chromium screenshots.
- `--headed`: ask upstream to show the browser window. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED`. Use it on the first launch, normally with `sessionMode: "fresh"` when changing an existing managed session. Successful first/fresh local wrapper-managed launches can expose `details.browserWindow.visibility: "unverified"` and a login handoff; attached browsers cannot, but still verify actual OS visibility with the user or screenshot/tab evidence.
- `--webgpu`: enable upstream's platform-specific WebGPU launch preset. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_WEBGPU`; config: `"webgpu": true`. Use it on a fresh local launch. It is incompatible while enabled with `--cdp`, `--auto-connect`, and provider launches. `AGENT_BROWSER_NO_XVFB=1` disables upstream's automatic Xvfb for displayless headed Linux sessions.
- `--no-webmcp`: disable experimental WebMCP support, which upstream 0.36.0 enables by default for locally managed Chrome. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_NO_WEBMCP`; config: `noWebmcp`. Use it on a fresh launch; `--no-webmcp false` explicitly enables the launch feature when config or environment disabled it.
- `--cdp <port|url>`: connect through Chrome DevTools Protocol. Use it, `--auto-connect`, or `connect <port|url>` once on a named/fresh session, verify with `get url`, then reuse that session without repeating the attach flag. After a successful attachment the wrapper avoids re-emitting its own compatibility launch argument; caller launch/config/file-access settings remain unchanged. Content-bearing first use is blocked until URL verification; later page reads/interactions live-check the URL because the attached browser can drift externally. `close` clears attachment state.
- `--color-scheme <scheme>`: `dark`, `light`, or `no-preference`. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_COLOR_SCHEME`.
- `--download-path <path>`: default browser download directory. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD_PATH`.
- `--engine <name>`: browser engine, `chrome` by default or `lightpanda`. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_ENGINE`.

On Android/Termux, follow the README setup to install the packaged Linux-musl arm64 upstream binary, install Termux's `which`, and expose its launcher as `$PREFIX/bin/chromium`. Prefer that upstream system-browser discovery over ambient `AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`: it survives isolated `HOME` values, works for ordinary calls and top-level `script`, and preserves the script security boundary that clears ambient launch controls and rejects inner `--executable-path` flags. Wrapper-generated Android managed identities use a compact 80-bit digest so ordinary namespaces and fresh rotations fit upstream's Unix socket path.

- `--no-auto-dialog`: disable automatic dismissal of alert/beforeunload dialogs. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_NO_AUTO_DIALOG`.
- `--idle-timeout <ms>`: native background browser lifecycle setting (also accepts `10s`, `3m`, `1h`). Caller-owned sessions retain native idle policy; an explicit flag is carried to every helper in that call. Keep it consistent between calls to avoid a native daemon restart. Only wrapper-owned sessions receive the implicit timeout and numeric mismatch check against `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_IMPLICIT_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`.

### Output, provider, policy, and AI flags

- `--json`: JSON output. The wrapper injects this automatically for normal tool execution. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_JSON`.
- `--annotate`: annotated screenshot with numbered labels and legend. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_ANNOTATE`.
- `--screenshot-dir <path>`: default screenshot output directory. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_SCREENSHOT_DIR`.
- `--screenshot-quality <n>`: JPEG quality `0-100`. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_SCREENSHOT_QUALITY`.
- `--screenshot-format <fmt>`: `png` or `jpeg`. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_SCREENSHOT_FORMAT`.
- `--content-boundaries`: wrap page output in boundary markers. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_CONTENT_BOUNDARIES`.
- `--max-output <chars>`: truncate page output to N characters. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_MAX_OUTPUT`.
- `--allowed-domains <list>`: restrict browser and `read` traffic to exact or `*.` wildcard domain patterns. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`. Use a fresh local Chrome context; upstream 0.32.0 owns containment and incompatible-mode rejection and disables Chromium `RTCPeerConnection` while active. The wrapper passes the setting and result through unchanged.
- `--action-policy <path>`: action policy JSON file. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_ACTION_POLICY`.
- `--confirm-actions <list>`: action categories requiring confirmation. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIRM_ACTIONS`.
- `--confirm-interactive`: interactive confirmations; auto-denies when stdin is not a TTY. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIRM_INTERACTIVE`.
- `-p, --provider <name>`: provider such as `ios`, `browserbase`, `kernel`, `browseruse`, `browserless`, or `agentcore`. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_PROVIDER`.
- `--device <name>`: iOS device name. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_IOS_DEVICE`.
- Provider-specific iOS examples from upstream include `agent-browser -p ios device list`, `agent-browser -p ios swipe up`, and `agent-browser -p ios tap @e1`; in pi, pass those tokens through `args` rather than bash. iOS requires external Xcode/Appium setup, and cloud providers (`browserbase`, `kernel`, `browseruse`, `browserless`, `agentcore`) require their upstream accounts, credentials, and provider-specific environment variables. Common provider variables include `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`, `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `BROWSERLESS_API_KEY`, `BROWSERLESS_API_URL`, `BROWSERLESS_BROWSER_TYPE`, `BROWSERLESS_STEALTH`, `BROWSERLESS_TTL`, `BROWSER_USE_API_KEY`, `KERNEL_API_KEY`, `KERNEL_HEADLESS`, `KERNEL_STEALTH`, `KERNEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `KERNEL_PROFILE_NAME`, `AGENTCORE_API_KEY`, `AGENTCORE_REGION`, `AGENTCORE_BROWSER_ID`, `AGENTCORE_PROFILE_ID`, `AGENTCORE_SESSION_TIMEOUT`, plus AWS names used by AgentCore such as `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_REGION`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`. The wrapper forwards parent environment variables plus provider flags and stays thin; it does not emulate provider setup or cloud browser behavior.
- `--model <name>`: AI model for `chat`. Environment: `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL`.
- `-v, --verbose`: show tool commands and raw output.
- `-q, --quiet`: show only AI text responses.
- `--debug`: debug output. Environment: `AGENT_BROWSER_DEBUG`.
- `AGENT_BROWSER_PLUGINS`: JSON plugin registry override for the upstream `plugin` commands.
- `--version`, `-V`: show version.

### Config precedence

Standalone `agent-browser` looks for `agent-browser.json` in these locations, from lowest to highest priority:

1. `~/.agent-browser/config.json` for user defaults.
2. `./agent-browser.json` for project overrides.
3. Environment variables, including `AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG`.
4. CLI flags.

Native `session` and `namespace` defaults are honored by ordinary tool calls before implicit-session generation; `sessionName` is only a legacy restore key. Per-call flags override environment, which overrides project/user JSON. `--config` or `AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG` selects one file instead of merging the discovered files; per-call config also reaches helper subprocesses. Caller-owned native `AGENT_BROWSER_SOCKET_DIR` is honored unless the wrapper-specific socket override is set. Script alone bypasses these defaults with an empty temporary config.

Use separated `--config <path>` to load a specific upstream config; upstream 0.33.2 does not recognize `--config=<path>` as the global selector. Browser-backed and sessionless native calls preserve `--config`, `AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG`, passive project/user config, and other upstream environment exactly as supplied. The Pi-scoped package config under `.pi/config/pi-agent-browser-native/` remains separate. Boolean flags accept optional `true` or `false` values, such as `--headed false`, `--webgpu false`, or `--no-webmcp false`, to override config. Browser extensions from user and project configs are merged rather than replaced.

Other useful environment variables include `AGENT_BROWSER_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`, `AGENT_BROWSER_AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL_MS`, `AGENT_BROWSER_STREAM_PORT`, `AGENT_BROWSER_STREAM_QUALITY`, `AGENT_BROWSER_STREAM_MAX_WIDTH`, `AGENT_BROWSER_STREAM_MAX_HEIGHT`, `AGENT_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `AGENT_BROWSER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AGENT_BROWSER_STATE_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `AGENT_BROWSER_IOS_DEVICE`, `AGENT_BROWSER_IOS_UDID`, `AI_GATEWAY_URL`, `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, provider credential names, and AWS credential names when using AgentCore. The upstream child receives the parent environment plus wrapper overrides such as the managed socket directory, clamped default operation timeout, canonical owned-session namespace (including empty default), and Pi-transcript- plus Git-checkout-generation-scoped `AGENT_BROWSER_RESTORE` for wrapper-owned managed sessions (`buildAgentBrowserProcessEnv` in `extensions/agent-browser/lib/process.ts`, ownership carried by the wrapper's typed process options and call-scoped managed-session context). Model-facing output still redacts recognized secret values.

## Wrapper-specific behavior worth knowing

- The extension may keep following one implicit managed session across later tool calls.
- If launch-scoped flags like `--profile`, `--args`, `--user-agent`, `--executable-path`, `--ca-cert`, `--no-ca-cert`, `--webgpu`, `--no-webmcp`, `--restore`, `--restore-save`, restore check flags, `--namespace`, `--session-name`, `--cdp`, `--state`, `--auto-connect`, `--init-script`, `--enable`, `--provider` / `-p`, or provider device flags like `--device` would replace or be ignored by an already-active managed session, retry with `sessionMode: "fresh"`. When the call explicitly names the current managed session, the structured recovery payload removes that `--session` so the fresh rotation can succeed.
- If a `sessionMode: "fresh"` call fails (including upstream failure, timeout, missing binary, or **`qa`** reclassification after a nominally successful batch), read `details.managedSessionOutcome` before assuming where the next default call will go: `preserved` means the prior managed session remains current, while `abandoned` means no managed session became current. When the failure reason is not the fresh launch itself—for example `failureCategory: "qa-failure"`—`status`/`summary` may still describe the managed-session transition while `succeeded` on this object matches the final tool outcome.

<!-- Generated from extensions/agent-browser/lib/playbook.ts. Run `npm run docs -- playbook write` to update. -->
- After open/goto/navigate calls with --profile, --restore, --session-name, or --state, agent_browser best-effort re-selects the tab whose URL matches the returned page when restored tabs steal focus during launch or reconnect.
- After confirmed shutdown of an automatically restored managed session, the wrapper retains its complete recorded URL, including the fragment, until the first current-page operation (including get url and reload). Non-page calls such as tab list may start a daemon without fulfilling that reopen; explicit URL reads leave the managed browser and pending reopen untouched. The wrapper uses native open once, verifies the observed tab, and discards old refs/frame scope; it does not restore unsaved forms, JavaScript memory, or history. Explicit navigation, caller-owned/attached sessions, and restore-disabled sessions are not auto-reopened.
- For a still-live browser after tab drift or resume, the wrapper verifies/selects the intended tab before ref/semantic helpers and page commands; failed selection stops the call without navigating. Local commands, read <url>, URL a11y/vitals, diff url, window new, and explicit tab/navigation/connection/state recovery do not require the prior tab. Batch checks follow effective rows past non-page prefixes and stop at explicit context changes, preserving caller argv/stdin and continue-on-error behavior. Same-tab reselection is avoided because it clears refs. Use exact batch --bail for fail-fast, not --bail=<value>. Routine same-session calls skip tab-list preflights.
- For sessions with observed tab-drift risk, after a successful command on a known target tab, agent_browser also best-effort restores that intended tab if a restored/background tab steals focus after the command completes. Routine same-session commands skip this post-command tab-list probe.
- If a known session target unexpectedly reports about:blank, agent_browser best-effort re-selects the prior intended target when it still exists; if recovery fails, it records the observed about:blank target and reports exact recovery guidance instead of treating the prior page as active.
- If upstream reports tab_gone, the pinned bound tab is gone; use details.nextActions (tab list / tab new) instead of assuming another tab is yours.
<!-- agent-browser-playbook:end wrapper-tab-recovery -->
- Wrapper-spawned commands clamp `AGENT_BROWSER_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` to the upstream documented 25-second default and use a 35-second child-process watchdog (`PI_AGENT_BROWSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides the default 35s budget; top-level `timeoutMs` overrides it per browser CLI call). Explicit `wait <ms>`, `wait --timeout <ms>`, and WebMCP `invoke` / `result --timeout <ms>` calls can exceed that default; when top-level `timeoutMs` is omitted, the wrapper derives a subprocess watchdog from the requested command duration plus a small grace window. Batch budgeting and timeout recovery read the same effective source as upstream: raw command strings when present, otherwise stdin rows. Dialog commands are additionally bounded to 5 seconds (`PI_AGENT_BROWSER_DIALOG_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS`), and click/tap/find refs or tokens plus `eval --stdin` snippets that look like alert/confirm/prompt/dialog triggers are bounded to 8 seconds (`PI_AGENT_BROWSER_DIALOG_TRIGGER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS`). A `session info` timeout returns only an exact-session `retry-session-info` status action, without page probes, liveness claims, or changes to existing page/ref state. When a browser-operation watchdog fires, `details.timeoutPartialProgress` may include a planned step list with per-step status (including `generatedFrom` labels for wrapper-inserted rows such as `open.loadState`) and a `retry-timeout-step` next action with a one-row native batch (`args: ["batch"]` plus `stdin`) only when the first incomplete step is read-only or idempotent, or `inspect-current-page-after-timeout` when the target is already verified but the incomplete step may be mutating and should not be blindly retried. If the target is unknown, standalone snapshots are removed and visible failure text plus `details.nextActions` show `verify-page-target-after-timeout`, including its session-scoped `batch --bail` args and short stdin for fail-fast `get url` then `snapshot -i`; dialog status/accept/dismiss actions remain allowed for blocking-dialog recovery. It also includes current page URL from best-effort session `get url`, followed by `get title` only after a URL is recovered (or a planned URL inferred from the step list when the session cannot answer), an `openedButPostOpenTimedOut` classification only when a live page URL was recovered before a later step hung, and declared artifact paths such as `screenshot`, `pdf`, `download`, or `wait --download` outputs with existence/state checks; the same evidence is appended under `Timeout partial progress` in visible text with URL/path redaction.
- Oversized snapshots and oversized generic outputs may be compacted in tool content, with the full redacted output written to a spill file path shown directly in the tool result. Recent artifact metadata is bounded by `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST_MAX_ENTRIES` (default 100); persisted spill files have a separate `PI_AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION_ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES` budget (default 32 MiB; `0` disables automatic eviction).
- The wrapper keeps `--help` and `--version` stateless so they do not consume the implicit managed-session slot.

## Maintenance rule

Whenever the upstream `agent-browser` binary version changes in this project:

1. run `agent-browser --version`, `agent-browser --help`, `agent-browser tab --help`, `agent-browser snapshot --help`, and `agent-browser wait --help`
2. update the canonical version in `scripts/agent-browser-target.mjs` and the help/doc inventory in `scripts/agent-browser-capability-baseline.mjs`
3. update the human-authored command reference sections if command semantics or recommended workflows changed
4. run `npm run docs -- command-reference write` to regenerate capability baseline blocks; do not manually edit generated blocks
5. run `npm run verify -- command-reference`
6. update tool prompt guidance if the recommended agent workflow changed
7. update README and release docs if user-visible behavior changed
8. validate the extension still exposes local documentation that is at least as usable as the blocked direct-binary path for normal agent work

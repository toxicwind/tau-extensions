# Platform smoke testing

`pi-agent-browser-native` uses a Crabbox-backed local platform smoke gate to prove the package on macOS, Ubuntu Linux, and native Windows before release.

This is a release-blocking gate. Missing setup is not a skipped pass. When a maintainer approves an [alternate native transport](#alternate-native-transports), it must prove the same target-local suites; missing upstream `agent-browser` or browser dependencies still blocks that target.

## Required release gate

Run the cheap harness checks first, build the project-owned Ubuntu image, run doctor explicitly, then run the full matrix and inspect the evidence:

```sh
npm run check:platform-smoke
npm run smoke:platform:ubuntu-image
npm run smoke:platform:doctor
npm run smoke:platform:all
crabbox list --provider local-container
crabbox list --provider parallels
```

`smoke:platform:all` also runs `smoke:platform:doctor` before any target suite starts, so the explicit doctor step is a readable release checklist step rather than a hidden precondition. The canonical `npm run verify -- release` gate also runs the configured-source lifecycle harness, then the same platform doctor and full `macos,ubuntu,windows-native` matrix after default verification and packaged Pi smoke, so `npm publish` cannot pass `prepublishOnly` without lifecycle and platform gates. After the matrix, inspect `.artifacts/platform-smoke/<run-id>/...` summaries and manifests; a green Crabbox exit without matching suite assertions is not release proof. Use provider-specific `crabbox list` commands for cleanup review because this host may have unrelated Crabbox providers configured that require credentials.

Per-target commands are for diagnosis:

```sh
npm run smoke:platform:macos
npm run smoke:platform:ubuntu
npm run smoke:platform:windows-native
npm run verify -- platform-smoke run --target ubuntu --suite platform-build
```

## Targets

| Target | Crabbox provider | Shell contract | Release status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `macos` | `ssh` static localhost | POSIX shell on macOS | Required |
| `ubuntu` | `local-container` | POSIX shell in a Docker-compatible local container | Required |
| `windows-native` | `parallels` | native Windows PowerShell over OpenSSH | Required |

## Alternate native transports

For the 0.6.12 release, local macOS execution replaces localhost SSH, and the [Native Windows workflow](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-browser-native/blob/main/.github/workflows/windows-native.yml) runs the existing Windows suites on a GitHub-hosted Windows runner. These are native platform checks, not Crabbox SSH or Parallels passes. The default `release` and `prepublishOnly` commands still select the Crabbox matrix; record alternate suite evidence separately rather than reporting those commands as passed.

On macOS, run the unchanged commands returned by `buildPlatformBuildCommand('macos', 'pi-agent-browser-native', 24)` and `buildBrowserDogfoodCommand('macos', '0.37.0', true)` in [`scripts/platform-smoke/targets.mjs`](../scripts/platform-smoke/targets.mjs), serially in a clean private source copy. Use private HOME, npm and Pi settings, and headless browser profiles. No Remote Login or host security change is required.

Retain the exact source head/tree, package and tool versions, native OS/architecture, generated commands, stdout/stderr, every `PLATFORM_*` exit marker, actual Pi registration output, dogfood JSON and verified screenshot. Check the suite assertions below and clean up only the run's processes and temporary files. Hosted Windows uploads this evidence from one bounded job; it does not upload installed projects, dependencies or browser profiles. These alternatives do not waive Ubuntu or any non-platform release check.

## Required environment

Install Crabbox on the macOS maintainer host and keep it on `PATH`:

```sh
brew install openclaw/tap/crabbox
crabbox --version
crabbox providers
```

Use Crabbox `0.26.0` or newer. Use `PLATFORM_SMOKE_CRABBOX=/path/to/crabbox` only when testing a non-default Crabbox binary.

Standard configuration knobs:

```sh
PLATFORM_SMOKE_MAC_HOST=localhost
PLATFORM_SMOKE_MAC_USER="$USER"
PLATFORM_SMOKE_MAC_WORK_ROOT="/Users/$USER/crabbox/pi-agent-browser-native"
# Optional only when localhost SSH does not use port 22.
PLATFORM_SMOKE_MAC_PORT=22

# Default local image built by npm run smoke:platform:ubuntu-image.
# The tag suffix is derived from scripts/agent-browser-capability-baseline.mjs.
PLATFORM_SMOKE_UBUNTU_IMAGE="pi-agent-browser-native-platform:node24-agent-browser<baseline-version>"

PLATFORM_SMOKE_WINDOWS_VM="pi-extension-windows-template"
PLATFORM_SMOKE_WINDOWS_SNAPSHOT="crabbox-ready-ab-0.33.0"
PLATFORM_SMOKE_WINDOWS_USER="<windows-ssh-user>"
PLATFORM_SMOKE_WINDOWS_WORK_ROOT="C:\\crabbox\\pi-agent-browser-native"

# Optional: names of secret env vars to redact/forward if future live suites need them.
PLATFORM_SMOKE_AUTH_ENV=""
```

The Ubuntu target image is derived from `node:24-bookworm`, installs the `agent-browser` version from [`scripts/agent-browser-capability-baseline.mjs`](../scripts/agent-browser-capability-baseline.mjs), installs Debian Chromium plus the upstream Linux WebGPU/Xvfb runtime packages (`libvulkan1`, `mesa-vulkan-drivers`, and `xvfb`) through apt, creates a non-root `circleci` user, and sets `AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium`. Rebuild it after upstream rebaselining, or override `PLATFORM_SMOKE_UBUNTU_IMAGE` with an equivalent prepared local image. Do not install `agent-browser` ad hoc inside the Ubuntu smoke command; a missing tool is image/template drift.

The configured upstream `agent-browser` baseline is imported from [`scripts/agent-browser-capability-baseline.mjs`](../scripts/agent-browser-capability-baseline.mjs). Target-local browser suites verify that exact `agent-browser` version before running. Bake the exact upstream CLI and browser runtime into the Windows template/snapshot for speed and reproducibility; missing or stale Windows `agent-browser` / browser readiness is a blocked setup, not something the smoke command repairs. The Windows browser suite checks the preinstalled browser cache and prewarms one short loopback HTTP URL before the extension harness runs.

## Target setup expectations

Crabbox does not install project runtime tools. The macOS host, Ubuntu image, and Windows template must already provide:

- Node/npm at or above the configured Node major baseline in [`platform-smoke.config.mjs`](../platform-smoke.config.mjs).
- Git and `tar`.
- Upstream `agent-browser` matching this wrapper’s capability baseline. The Ubuntu target gets it from [`scripts/platform-smoke/linux-image/Dockerfile`](../scripts/platform-smoke/linux-image/Dockerfile); the Windows template gets it from the shared `pi-extension-windows-template` snapshot named in [`platform-smoke.config.mjs`](../platform-smoke.config.mjs) (currently `crabbox-ready-ab-0.33.0`, a child of the shared `crabbox-ready` base used by other projects' linked clones).
- Browser/runtime dependencies needed by upstream `agent-browser`.
- Native PowerShell and OpenSSH Server on Windows.

For Windows, reuse `pi-extension-windows-template` with the power-off snapshot configured in [`platform-smoke.config.mjs`](../platform-smoke.config.mjs). Do not create one-off project VMs or run tests directly on the source VM. If a reusable tool is missing, update the shared template from the current base snapshot, verify from a fresh SSH session, remove caches/secrets/checkouts, shut down cleanly, and promote a known-good power-off snapshot (a child snapshot is fine when other projects still hold linked clones of an older base).

## What the suites prove

Each required target runs `platform-build` and `browser-dogfood-smoke` on one Crabbox lease, serially.

### `platform-build`

1. Verify the target Node major version.
2. Run `npm ci` in the synced checkout.
3. Run `npm run verify -- platform-target`, a fast target-local gate covering generated docs, TypeScript, package/platform harness tests, and runtime planning. The full unit/fake suite still runs once in the host default gate before the release matrix starts; target-local smoke must not duplicate that full suite on every OS. Browser subprocess behavior is then exercised by the target-local `browser-dogfood-smoke` suite against the real upstream binary.
4. Run `npm pack`.
5. Create a clean target-local Pi project.
6. Install the packed tarball with `npm install --no-save`.
7. Run `pi install -l --approve ./node_modules/pi-agent-browser-native` from the clean project so Pi 0.84.0+ trusts the generated project-local settings for that command.
8. Run `pi list --approve` and assert the package is registered under project packages from the packed install.
9. Assert the release proof did not use `pi -e .` or `pi --extension .`.

### `browser-dogfood-smoke`

1. Run `npm ci` in the synced checkout if needed.
2. Run the deterministic model-free browser smoke through `scripts/verify-agent-browser-dogfood.ts`.
3. Exercise native wrapper surfaces against the deterministic loopback HTTP fixture from `scripts/verify-agent-browser-dogfood.ts`: top-level `qa`, `semanticAction`, constrained `job`, screenshot artifact verification, and session close.
4. Persist the dogfood JSON report and stdout/stderr evidence.
5. Fail on missing browser artifacts, failed tool calls, leaked secrets, or unclosed sessions.

The dogfood suite intentionally uses the checkout harness while `platform-build` proves packed Pi installation. Together they catch OS-specific packaging, install, path, process, browser, and wrapper bugs without using an LLM.

## Artifact contract

Every target run writes host-side evidence under one run id shared by that target’s suites:

```text
.artifacts/platform-smoke/<run-id>/<target>/<suite>/
```

Required files include:

```text
summary.json           # includes ok, target, suite, exit code, elapsed time, writtenAt
artifact-manifest.json
target.json            # package, package version, Crabbox binary/version, provider, work root/image/template
suite.json
command.txt
exit-code.txt
crabbox.stdout.txt
crabbox.stderr.txt
crabbox.timing.json
assertions.json
failures.md            # only when assertions fail
```

`platform-build` also writes:

```text
node-version.txt
packed-tarball.txt
packed-node-install.stdout.txt
packed-node-install.stderr.txt
pi-install.stdout.txt
pi-install.stderr.txt
pi-list.stdout.txt
pi-list.stderr.txt
```

`browser-dogfood-smoke` also writes:

```text
node-version.txt
dogfood-artifacts.txt
dogfood.stdout.txt
dogfood.stderr.txt
dogfood-report.json
```

Each target also writes a `lease-cleanup` artifact directory with `crabbox.stop.*` files. Cleanup failures are failing test results. Ubuntu and Windows runs also invoke Crabbox cleanup for stale direct-provider state after stopping the owned lease.

Passing suites must satisfy:

```text
summary.ok === assertions.ok
artifact-manifest.missing.length === 0
```

The harness redacts configured secret values and token-like text from persisted artifacts, then fails if a redaction scan still finds raw secrets.

 * Cross-process liveness for session history retention.
 *
 * History files live in directories shared by every process resolving the
 * same repository commonDir, but each process's in-memory
 * active-session set only covers its own sessions. A retention sweep in
 * process A can therefore target a session that process B is actively
 * loading or saving. Every store touches a `.active.<sessionHash>` marker in
 * the history directory on each load and save; sweepers treat a fresh marker
 * as proof of life no matter which process wrote it and skip the session.
 *
 * The TTL is deliberately generous: a stale marker left by a crashed owner
 * merely delays expiration of already-old history, while a false negative
 * durably destroys live undo state. Markers whose owners stopped beating are
 * pruned by the same sweeps so the directory stays bounded.
